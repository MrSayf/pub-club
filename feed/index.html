				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one thing to create an ad and start advertising on Facebook, but it’s something else entirely to track all the numbers you get in return and apply it for the ultimate success of your business.  The numbers might not match the goals you had in mind. Or maybe those goals have changed. What do you do now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, every advertising campaign will need to be tweaked at some point.  Rarely does anyone get it right the very first time, especially when they’re first starting and aren’t too familiar with their audience yet.  You can make some wild (or even educated) guesses, but you won’t truly know how the market will react until you’re out there in the thick of it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight, so even if your ads are running smoothly, there’s room for improvement.  You’re going to have to optimize your campaign and scale your ads. First, let’s take a look at ways you can better define your objectives to create the best plan possible.</span></p>
<p><b>What Are Your Goals?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing your ads doesn’t start after you’ve already created them, but before.  You need a good targeting strategy and goals planned beforehand. How will you know if the ads are performing well if you don’t have your goals mapped out?  This is your only measure of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need to understand what Facebook is. It’s a social networking site.  When people jump on Facebook, they’re doing it interact with friends and hang out.  They hop on to relax and clear the mind after a long day. That’s why it’s difficult to sell products and can involve some complex processes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook being committed to sharing only user-relevant content, you need to find a way to brand yourself in a way that’s relevant to potential customers.  Do you advertise in ways that fit neatly on their Newsfeed? Is your content organic? This will ultimately matter as you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal when it comes to advertising on Facebook is brand awareness.  Facebook isn’t great with direct sales. It will take time, targeting, and energy as you develop relationships with your potential customers.  To get any kind of traction on Facebook, you must be content-driven. Most products or services are ‘discovered’ on Facebook through content.</span></p>
<p><b>Split Testing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you spend time and money working out your ad campaigns, your job isn’t done.  The most recommended method to determining what works and what doesn’t is by split-testing.  Split testing (or A/B testing) is a way to determine what graphics, copy, imagines, headlines, and call-to-actions drive more of your targeted audience to convert.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to know off hand which ads will work.  You can have all the right stuff together, but if the call-to-action needs more work or there’s an off word, that creates a snag in the reader’s mind.  By split testing, you will get to uncover the ads and designs that best work with your demographic. This is why the road to successful Facebook campaigning is a complex one.</span></p>
<p><b>Catchy Images</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are visual creatures.  As a person scrolls down their newsfeed, your ad is competing with hundreds of different posts, images, graphics, and videos.  It can be so jam-packed with content that their eyes never even find your ad. Or they see it, but they see something else that grabs their attention even more, so they click on the other thing and forget about your content completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to ensure you have a catchy image that grab’s the user’s attention is the process of creating buyer personas.  Write down a persona for every type of person who might want to buy from you. If you have a persona mapped out, you will see that there are so many different types of people, who are interested in different things, but might have in common one thing: your product or service.  </span></p>
<p><b>Fault Finding and Scaling</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will come a time when you have to scale your Facebook ads.  And it can be a challenging process. The way a lot of marketers handle scaling is to just throw more money at their ads, hoping to increase their broader reach.  Throwing more money into your ads rarely works because of the lack of proper targeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need is to breathe more life into your tired campaign.  This is necessary for your success, because no matter how awesome your ads are, if you don’t put them in front of the right eyes, they don’t do that well.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the most part, technology hasn’t changed the way humans have lived for most of our history on this planet.  Think about it for a second.  For thousands of years, what mode of transportation have our ancestors shared?  Horses.  Wagons.  It wasn’t until 1885 when Karl Benz invented the first car.  Look at how far we’ve come just in the last 100+ years.</p>
<p>In 1914, if you wanted to travel to Asia from the United States, it would’ve taken you 40 days.  Now, we have supersonic jets that will cross the Pacific in about 14 hours. As of this writing, they are currently researching and building jets that can take you from New York to London in about 20 minutes.  </p>
<p>Travel is just the beginning.  Think about all the advancements in medicine, hygiene, genetics, vaccines, food, surgical care, housing, consumer products, buying and selling, radio, TV, video games, electricity, heat/air conditioning, refrigeration, telephones, space travel, cameras, and computers.  These are all relatively new advancements that have changed the course of human history forever.</p>
<p>These advances haven’t only impacted the way we live and how we entertain ourselves, but it also changed the business world forever.  Thanks to the internet, we’re now a highly-connected species.  Who would’ve ever imagined having the ability to video chat with someone instantly who lived on the other side of the planet?  </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Founder of Facebook, boasts having connected nearly 2 billion people with his platform.  That’s 2 billion people who are spread out across the globe, but thanks to the internet, they might as well be in the next room.  This type of connectivity has allowed for major changes in how we do business.</p>
<p>Consider that for thousands of years, up until about 15-20 years ago, the strongest industries were involved in natural resources, like coal, oil, wood, and mining.  Suddenly, the internet goes commercial, connecting the world, and changing how companies compete globally.  The top companies in the world are now tech giants, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.</p>
<p>CEOs now make billions on ideas, instead of commodities.</p>
<p>As the world continues to get smaller, we are becoming more of a melting pot.  Cultures are mixing, as are languages and lifestyles.  When you have a variety of different people and languages living in one area, it can complicate the infrastructure of government, business, schools, and even the economy</p>
<p>As a budding entrepreneur, the secret to success is tapping into this resource and knowing how to use technology to your advantage. There’s no other medium where you can reach across the globe and advertise your products to millions than social media. You’ll have to learn about demographics, scaling ads, and how to reach an audience.</p>
<p>If you want your website to get traffic, you’ll need to know how to utilize SEO in your content. You’ll need to design a website that’s fast, efficient, and catches the eye.</p>
<p>The toughest part for new online entrepreneurs to understand is how quickly the tech is changing. It seems as if new stuff comes out every other day. If you struggle with keeping up, or you have no idea where to start, you have two options:</p>
<p>1) Take several years and try to figure it out yourself.<br />
2) Find a company who already knows how to do it and hire them.</p>
<p>Agencies like Pub Club Leads are experts helping people get on the right track right out of the gate. The last thing you want to do is start your business already behind. It costs new entrepreneurs several years and many thousands of dollars’ worth of failed attempts before they get a grasp on what they’re doing.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re doing, your best bet is to ask for help. It doesn’t matter if you need a little bit of help, or a lot of it. All it takes is a single wrongly-worded ad to keep your sales down.</p>
<p>The technology revolution isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Right now is the perfect time to pursue that business idea, but don’t do it alone. Let Pub Club Leads guide you through the process and give you the edge you need to outsmart your competitors and make the kind of money you always dreamed you’d make working from home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one thing to create an ad and start advertising on Facebook, but it’s something else entirely to track all the numbers you get in return and apply it for the ultimate success of your business.  The numbers might not match the goals you had in mind. Or maybe those goals have changed. What do you do now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, every advertising campaign will need to be tweaked at some point.  Rarely does anyone get it right the very first time, especially when they’re first starting and aren’t too familiar with their audience yet.  You can make some wild (or even educated) guesses, but you won’t truly know how the market will react until you’re out there in the thick of it.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight, so even if your ads are running smoothly, there’s room for improvement.  You’re going to have to optimise your campaign and scale your ads. First, let’s take a look at ways you can better define your objectives to create the best plan possible. </span></p>
<p><b>What Are Your Goals?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing your ads doesn’t start after you’ve already created them, but before.  You need a good targeting strategy and goals planned beforehand. How will you know if the ads are performing well if you don’t have your goals mapped out?  This is your only measure of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need a good understanding of what Facebook is. It’s a social networking site.  When people jump on Facebook, they’re doing it interact with friends and hang out. They hop on to relax and clear the mind after a long day.  That’s why selling can involve some complex processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook being committed to sharing only user-relevant content, you need to find a way to brand yourself in a way that’s relevant to potential customers.  Do your advertisement fit neatly on their Newsfeed? Is your content organic? This will ultimately matter, as you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal when it comes to advertising on Facebook is brand awareness.  As we covered previously, Facebook isn’t great with direct sales. It will take time, targeting, and energy as you develop relationships with your potential customers.  To get any kind of traction on Facebook, you must be content-driven. Most products or services are ‘discovered’ on Facebook through content. </span></p>
<p><b>Split Testing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you spend time and money working out your ad campaigns, your job isn’t done.  The most recommended method to determining what works and what doesn’t is by split-testing.  Split testing (or A/B testing) is a way to determine what graphics, copy, imagines, headlines, and call-to-actions drive more of your targeted audience to convert.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to know off hand which ads will work.  You can have all the right stuff together, but the call-to-action needs more work or there’s an off word that creates a snag in the reader’s mind.  By split testing, you will get to uncover the ads and designs that best work with your demographic. This is why the road to successful Facebook campaigning is a complex one. </span></p>
<p><b>Catchy Images</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: humans are visual creatures.  As a person scrolls down their newsfeed, your ad is competing with hundreds of different posts, images, graphics, and videos.  It can be so jam-packed with content that their eyes never even find your ad. Or they see it, but they see something else that grabs their attention even more, so they click on the other thing and forget about your content completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to ensure you have a catchy image that grab’s the user’s attention is the process of creating buyer personas.  If you have a persona mapped out, you will see that there are so many different types of people, who are interested in different things, but might have in common one thing: your product or service.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there only one type of person who likes Anime?  No. You have people of all ages, genders, and nationalities who enjoy it.  But, by studying different demographics, you can put together a broad idea of what age group likes what.  So, if you’re selling anime shirts for girls, what is that buyer persona? What age group is into anime the most?  What are the things they’re most likely into? A picture will begin to form and you’ll see the types of images that attract them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you might try some different contrasts.  While you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to create an image that grabs your customer’s attention, why not look at creating something that’s different and opposite?  Our brains do well at noticing something that’s out of place, which might work with your ad. </span></p>
<p><b>Fault Finding and Scaling</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will come a time when you have to scale your Facebook ads.  And it can be a challenging process. The way a lot of marketers handle scaling is to just throw more money at their ads, hoping to increase their broader reach.  But throwing more money into your ads rarely works, because ads with a lack of targeting are doomed to fail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need is to breathe more life into your tired campaign.  This is necessary for your success, because no matter how awesome your ads are, if you don’t put them in front of the right eyes, they don’t do that well.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, you’ll end up wasting more money.  Instead, you’ll have to bite the bullet and do a bit of fault finding and scaling of your ads to reach a new audience.  Here are several proven scaling methods to help you continue to target your audience, even the one you don’t have yet, but desperately need to reach out to. </span></p>
<p><b>Discover New Potential Customer Personas</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One factor we already touched on was creating a buyer persona for your perfect type of audience.  If you know who you have to market for, doing demographic research can be a breeze. But as a lot of marketers have their set buyer persona, they might only focus on those which have been successful in the past, ultimately limiting your growth.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give an example, let’s say you sell protein supplements.  You’ve had decent success with your typical buyer persona: bodybuilders.  You might also target those who are interested in getting in shape. But to scale up and reach other personas, you might look at anyone who could benefit from having more protein in their diet, including:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Anyone on a high-protein diet, like Atkins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Anyone who has joined a gym or has expressed interest in doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Women who recently had a baby and is looking to tone back up. </span></p>
<p><b>Segmenting</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One great way to scale your ads is to segment them.  Essentially, segmenting is a form of hyper-targeting.  When you target an ad, you’re going after the one group of people you feel will respond the greatest.  By segmenting, you’ll take a variety of different factors and personas and create ads specifically based on each one.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the high-protein supplements.  You might brand them to men and women differently, since men and women workout differently, build muscle differently, and have different problem areas. Men build muscle quicker and have a single need where you might have to reach out to women by different methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t end there.  Even within the women group, you might consider segmenting further.  One ad is for teen girls. Another ad is to reach potential moms. Another might be to those who already have kids.  And another could be post-menopausal women. You would stick them into their own buyer persona and create different ads for each. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook demographics, as wide and vast as they are, there are so many factors to consider.  Married versus single. Older versus younger. Parent or not? Sedentary lifestyle or active? Segmenting gives you more options to be creative and hyper-target the perfect audience for you.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just a few things to consider. If you’re not scaling and optimizing your ads, you’re just throwing time and money down the drain. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start this off with a bold statement: if you want to run a successful business, then you need to have an email marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to evolve and new marketing strategies are developed, one strategy has stood the test of time.  In fact, for the last decade, email marketing has ruled the online landscape.</span></p>
<p><b>Email is Better than Social Networking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s market, a lot of business owners focus on social networking.  It’s a great way to drive traffic, but it’s not the best way to make a buck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more active email accounts out there today than there are users on both Facebook and Twitter combined. When a potential customer opts-in, they’re giving you an opportunity to pitch to them directly. It’s personal and intimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook ads can be wasted money.  Statistically speaking, only 2% of your list will see your ad. It’s easy to scroll by and miss the information you want them to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send an email, it forces the customer to act.  They can’t just scroll by the email. They’re forced to look at it and decide whether it’s worth opening.</span></p>
<p><b>Crunching the Numbers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ROI for email marketing is $38 for every $1 spent.  That’s a return of 3,800%! You’re not going to find those kinds of numbers anywhere! The problem is, most business owners don’t know how to properly use email marketing to get that that type of return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It often takes a year or more of tinkering around, playing with keywords, studying headlines, building relationships, and delivering adequate content to increase your return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has the time or the money to strategize and wait for the results to start rolling in?  Is your email campaign actually costing you money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to tell your story and sell your brand in a way that gets customers to click and buy.</span></p>
<p><b>Having Your Own Cheat Sheet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to use email marketing the right way is like getting in shape.  You know what your goals are, but you don’t know how to get there. There’s nothing wrong with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s not designed for you and your goals, it’s a waste of time.  That’s why we exist. We’re successful at helping business owners take the next step and are here to give you that helping hand as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the benefits of being able to automate your campaign.  That means the money is still coming in, even while you’re sleeping!  If you want to go on vacation, that’s perfectly fine. Your campaign is still making money while you’re sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel that your email campaign is lackluster or that you’ve tried everything to improve your ROI, but nothing seems to work, Pub Club Leads can help get your campaign on track. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a blog can be quite simple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need any real technical know-how to do it. You need to know your way around a computer, but you don’t have to be a programmer or know a thing about HTML to set up a great-looking blog. Here are some basic tips, and then we’ll talk about some of the specific options that are available to you.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Pick a snappy name. You want something memorable. It should be unique – meaning you need to research to make sure nobody else has used the name – and relevant to your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Before you set up your blog and it goes live, you should have some content prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should also think about design. The blogging platforms we will discuss here will provide you with templates to use, but you should have an idea of what you want in terms of colors and the overall feel of your blog.  </span></p>
<p><b>Free Options </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned earlier, there are several free options available to you if you don’t have money to spend on your blog. The downside of setting up a free blog is that you won’t own the website. Your URL will include an extension, meaning that instead of:  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yourawesomeblog.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.YourAwesomeBlog.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will look like: </span><a href="http://www.yourawesomeblog.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.YourAwesomeBlog.wordpress.com</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be somewhat at the mercy of the blog hosting site, too. If they go offline for any reason, your blog will be offline as well. Here are some of the most popular free options for blogging:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.WordPress. It’s important to note here that we are talking about WordPress.com, which is a free blogging platform. WordPress.org is software that bloggers use to build their own websites. Setting up a blog on WordPress is very easy. They provide bloggers with dozens of free templates to choose from, and a host of easy-to-use blogging and editing tools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can write blog posts in advance and schedule them for publication, and it’s easy to format text and add images.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.Blogger. Blogger is very similar to WordPress. They provide free templates, drafting, and editing tools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.Weebly. Weebly has a slightly quirkier feel than the other sites mentioned, but it has many of the same features. Again, the big downside of using a free blogging platform is that you won’t own your blog. Your domain name will be diluted by the additional extension on it.  </span></p>
<p><b>Paid Options </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other option you have available to you is to pay to set up your blog. By far the most popular way to do that is to use WordPress.org. WordPress has hundreds of templates available – many are free, but some you may have to pay to use. You can choose a template that is mobile-ready (which I recommend) and choose from hundreds of Plugins that will add features to your blog.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also consider putting your blog on your own website, but that will mean that you might have to wait while you get your website designed and ready to go – something we’ll talk about in the next chapter. You will have the option of migrating your blog from WordPress to your website once you get it set up.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Blogs to Increase Authority </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s talk about why blogging is, in my opinion, one of the best things you can do to increase your authority. To be an authority in a particular niche, it’s not enough simply to have knowledge. You need to have opinions. You need to add value to the conversation by bringing something new to it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, if someone wants the information that’s already available about your niche, they can do exactly what you just did, right? They can research, buy books, watch videos, and educate themselves. There’s no point of blogging if you’re just going to regurgitate information that’s already out there. The best way to use blogging to increase your authority is to find a way to bring something unique to the table.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Find someone else’s old blog post about a key topic, and update it by including new information and adding your personal twist, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Offer up a controversial opinion about something relevant in your niche  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Give your readers advice about how to do something you haven’t seen explained elsewhere.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few options, but I hope you get the idea. You’re going to have competition no matter what you do, but you can always find a way to make something fresh by coming at it from a new angle.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can know the basic definition of authority and desire to be an authority figure in your niche, but it’s something else entirely to know how to convert that knowledge into actual success.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, without the numbers to back up what you say you know, people won’t be too eager to follow you or recognize your authority status.  The fact that I’m an authority figure is a result of my knowledge bringing people (and businesses) to my door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me explain.  The four main pillars of online authority are </span><b>content marketing, social media presence, paid advertising, and publicity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Let’s break this down into individual chunks.   </span></p>
<p><b>Content marketing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most important and crucial aspects you need to master if you want to establish yourself as an authority figure.  As I sort of stated above, without regular content, you cease to be relevant. Any piece of content you publish online qualifies as content marketing, whether you publish regular blogs, articles, videos, or podcasts.  It doesn’t matter what you produce as long as it provides your audience quantifiable value. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also crucial to your success when establishing authority.  Many businesses live or die by how well they are able to communicate via social media.  As of right now, over 2 billion people worldwide use it, and that number is only expected to grow.  This means you need to figure out a way to use this technological advantage in an intelligent way. That means choosing the right social media outlets for your niche and being careful about the content you share. </span></p>
<p><b>Paid advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great for giving your website and social media accounts a bit of a push if you’re having a difficult time drawing traffic without it.  Again, if people haven’t heard of you, you’re not an authority. </span></p>
<p><b>And finally, publicity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re going to have to figure out new and creative ways to get your name out there.  There are plenty of ways to publicize yourself, both online and offline. Build up your social media profiles, attend high-profile events, give speeches, interview other experts in your niche, volunteer, and so much more.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on these four things, you become an authority (an expert) over time.  Most people begin to trust you and frequent your sites. That means that people will be beating a path to your door hoping to get your help and advice – and that can lead you to success in a number of different ways.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Authority to Your Benefit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a proven track record, you can start charging a consulting fee.  Some of what you used to give away for free to develop your authority status, you will now be charging for.  Set up a paid subscription service or even products/content that you will sell, like a book! Teach an online seminar or class.  Offer paid speaking engagements. These are just a few ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have information that people want, you can name your own price. I don’t mean to imply that it’s easy to become an authority – but it doesn’t have to be difficult, either. You’ll have to put in the time and effort to learn about your chosen topic and produce great content that people will want to consume and share. You can’t be an authority without that. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce sales hit new record highs for 2016 and 2017. The same will be true in 2018, especially as the economy continues to roll. With wages growing and people paying less in taxes, we can only expect the 2018 season, Christmas especially, to offer plenty of bonuses and surprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the growth of retail sales overall, 42% of it happened online. As each year passes, it would seem as if e-commerce sales have double digit increases. In 2016, e-commerce sales rose by 15.6%, coming in just shy of $400 billion. In 2017, online sales were 18% higher still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who’s been alive for the last 20 years can see how dramatically the Internet has changed the way we shop, work, and live. The Internet has conquered many industries and sent once proud and flourishing businesses running for the hills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember Blockbuster? Replaced by Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever been to Borders books? Replaced by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can write an entire case study based upon Amazon alone. They’re currently building fulfillment centers near every major US city and are developing advanced technologies, such as the use of drones, to make deliveries quicker and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to wonder if the advancement of Amazon is why most major retail stores, who were vastly unprepared for the Internet age, are quickly going out of business. Sales do not look good for the major brick-and-mortar outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the brick-and-mortar stores seem to be on the decline, retail sales overall jumped by 3.9%. How is that possible? Well, let’s just say there’s a reason why Walmart is now calling for an all-out war against Amazon for a piece of the online action. This comes as Walmart closes more stores and lays off more workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Now is the Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had one piece of advice for you, it would be to jump in right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are just now starting to get wise to the fact that they can make big money by taking advantage of the massive growth in e-commerce sales. New students in the game currently are raking in $5,000 to $10,000 each month. And that’s just the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce market is smoking hot and it is growing by leaps and bounds each year. During the holidays, Black Friday was the only day you could get amazing sales, but now there’s Cyber Monday to take advantage of the rapid increase of online sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to jump into something that not a whole lot of people know yet, but continues to be in a massive upward trend, it would be ecommerce. As larger chunks of retail sales are made online, you’ll be in the prime spot to take advantage of this niche for years to come.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of marketing truths that seem to fight against human nature. When a lot of new marketers and business owners try to advertise, get the word out, and build authority in their niche, they think about the big picture all at once. When they create ads, they make the mistake of trying to blast their message to everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, 90% of new online businesses go under. One of the biggest reasons why include trying to do too much and being everything to everyone. You’re going to waste money throwing a handful of spaghetti at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. The only way to set yourself apart is by narrowing down your niche and your speciality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don’t Be a Jack-of-all-Trades</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the fastest ways to become an industry leader is by choosing a niche and sticking with it.  You might think it’s an obvious statement, but you’d be surprised by how many people are either stuck and don’t know where to begin or work in general terms, not really choosing one niche, but many.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t be an authority figure in a single market if you consider yourself a jack-of-all-trades.  Dabbling in multiple markets makes sure you stay mediocre because your attention is diverted to different projects at once.  Instead, focus on one project and stick with it.  Not only does it make things simpler for you, you can get a faster start building from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><b>Education-Based Marketing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we attempt to be the best, we often see everyone else as competition, as if there’s only room for one at the top. This is a very cold way of getting things done, as you’re missing out on greater opportunities to reach out and build a community.  Our world is changing.  As we become more globalist in the way we live and do business, it’s no longer feasible to cut anyone out.  Your greatest consumers may very well be your competition.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet has also changed the way we do sales.  Consumers expect immediate access in this digital-driven age.  If you have no way of building trust, you’re not going to get far.  Education-based marketing builds trust quicker than someone who uses traditional marketing.  Rather than using the same tired sales pitches, use blogs, books, and other types of content to educate and give the type of information to help buyers make the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then use this educational-based content and get it published in various outlets.  If you can tell your customers that you’re a published author in the field of marketing, or that you’ve had an article you wrote featured in a top magazine, you have instant authority.  They will feel like they can trust you and are more eager to open their wallet over someone with no content to share at all. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Doing One Thing Really Well</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about restaurants for a moment. The local pizza shop also sells burgers on the cheap. If you really want a great burger, do you go to those guys, or the actual burger shop down the road that’s a bit more expensive? You know exactly who to go to if you want a great burger. The pizza shop who tries to do everything most likely doesn’t even have the best pizza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because they’re focused on trying to do too much. They don’t put out the best product and shouldn’t be considered a leader in the industry. They might make a few bucks on their cheap burgers, but they won’t be the company you think about when you’re really craving a juicy cheeseburger. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business works the same way. By creating educational-based marketing and focusing on that one area of expertise, you can be the ‘go-to’ business your customers flock to. They’re eager to learn and improve their lives, so no matter what you do, they’ll come running back, willing to open their wallets again and again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out a specific niche and start from there.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has ever decided to start their own business knows how difficult it can be to break through the noise and reach the top of their chosen industry.  In some circumstances, it can even seem impossible.  How do you reach your market with a blog when there are over 100 million blogs out there in cyberspace already?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is your website going to set you apart from your competitors when there are hundreds of millions of websites out there right this second?  Often, a lot of entrepreneurs give up their dreams of starting a business because the deck seems so incredibly stacked against them from the start.  It’s not a lack of passion or hard work, but of authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the work you’re putting in right now that will separate you from your competitors?  How are you differentiating yourself in your niche market that’s making the industry sit up and pay attention?  How are you reaching new clients and customers in a way that is unique and engaging?  The people are hungry for content, yet a lot of business owners do the bare minimum, hoping they take off like a rocket.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to expand into many different realms and markets, there will be no shortage of opportunities to come up with the next big idea, but also no shortage of competition.  Intense competition means you can either take a backseat and hope something turns viral or you can take the bull by its horns and step up your game.   </span></p>
<p><b>Being a Leader is Never Easy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming from a position of authority isn’t easy for everyone.  Some people seem to be born leaders while others are content holding back for the sake of self-preservation.  Being a leader means being vulnerable and open to attack.  Let’s use McDonalds as an example.  McDonald’s is at the very top of all the fast food restaurants, both in profits and the number of restaurants available.  They’ve cornered the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did McDonald&#8217;s get to the top?  Was it because they have the best hamburgers?  No.  The best customer service?  Not really.  The answer is, they provided value to their customers.  They were different and vastly stood out.  The same goes for becoming an authority figure.  You don’t have to be the world’s number one expert at what you do.  You just have to be good enough to continue growing and expanding while providing value in an underutilized market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is, it’s human nature to sink below the waterline and not be different from the crowd.  We fear confrontation and everyone else in your market will be trying to take you down.  Is McDonald&#8217;s the unhealthiest of all the fast food chains?  Again, not really.  There are other companies that have vastly greater portions, but because McDonalds is at the top, they get most the bad press.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being the leader is worth it.  Everyone around the world recognizes the Golden Arches.  Despite not being the best at what they do, they still reign as the true king of fast food sales, and it’s not even close.  In 2014, McDonalds brought in $35 billion in sales, while their closest competitor, Subway, only brought in $12 billion.  How did they do it, while overcoming the attacks that routinely come from competitors?  AUTHORITY. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Educate Your Audience with Content</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been paying any attention whatsoever to the leaders of many industries, there is one thing they do that really sets them apart from anyone else.  They don’t remain focused on their business goals exclusively.  They’re still pulling in big bucks, but they take advantage of their platform to step outside of their comfort zone.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve spent many years cultivating knowledge, gaining experience, and slaying obstacles, it’s one thing to use that to build your own business, but something else altogether to help lift other people out of the mud.  You see, a lot of these top people in their field gain almost a celebrity status.  How?  With content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them have a book.  They have blogs.  They’re constantly sharing different strategies they picked up in their own journey that helps someone else lower on the totem pole overcome a challenge in their own business.  And when that happens, what does it do for the guy on top?  What did he just create by helping others?  He gained respect and authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is truly how you become an industry leader. People flock to you and are more willing to open their wallets to you if they know you have something to offer. If you’re the person taking care of their needs, then you’re set for life.</span></p>
