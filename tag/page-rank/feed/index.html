				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for a reason to upgrade your website, this is it! Google announced earlier this week their intention to implement a new mobile search algorithm designed to give preference to faster sites.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google calls it the “Speed Update” and not everyone will feel the impact. If your site measures up in the speed department, you’ll likely see no change in how you’re ranked. According to the search engine giant, only a “small percentage” of sites, the ones who consistently rank low when it comes to loading times.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is yet another step by Google to improve user performance. It was only back in 2010 when they stated their full intention and focus was on desktop user speed, but it was only a few short years later in 2014 when the number of mobile users surpassed those who used the site on their desktop.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this shift in user preference, many industries have had to change the way they create and display ads. They suddenly had to be both desktop and mobile friendly, a lesson Facebook instantly learned when the mobile revolution took off. They weren’t prepared and had one of the worst online mobile apps on the internet.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing how quickly things were changing, Facebook, went into action and continues to find new ways to give mobile users the best experience possible. Now Google is jumping in and rewarding the sites with faster speeds.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is clear: if you’re not actively working to improve mobile reach, your competitors will get the traffic. It’s okay though. You have plenty of time to prepare your website for the change. The new algorithm isn’t set to be in place until July 2018.</span></p>
