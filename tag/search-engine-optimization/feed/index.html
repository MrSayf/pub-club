				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is essential. If people don’t know you exist, how can find you?  And if they can’t find you, you’re simply not making the sales you need to be successful.  While some marketing will offer results, the right kind of marketing can be the difference between mediocre sales and taking off like a rocket. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, good marketing is like a candle in a dark cave.  It will illuminate not just your product, but your entire empire.  Your eyes and your attention will be drawn towards the light!  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right type of marketing,  doesn’t take much to convince your audience that they NEED your product or service, nor can they live without it.  It resonates with them deep down inside.  It identifies their needs.  It educates them and promises to make them better at life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Marketing Basics</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the big secret for marketing the right way?  It’s all about targeting the right crowd.  Your marketing should attract your target audience, not every single person you can get the message to.  Think about it like this: a bug zapper was designed to attract bugs.  That’s what it was built to do.  It’s not meant to attract kangaroos or crocodiles.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources are finite and attempting to attract people who do not fit the target audience is just like setting your money on fire.  Why?  It goes back to knowing the basics.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People buy things for two reasons: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) For gain. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They want to raise their personal brand and improve their image.  To impress.  Maybe it’s the girl they have a crush on or to secure a promotion.  Maybe it entertains them in ways other products cannot.  The purchase is made with one thing in mind: If I buy this product, what will it do for me?   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often do and buy things because it improves the way other people see us.  How many times have you purchased an item simply to build a relationship with someone?  Whatever we purchase, it’s done with gain in mind.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Rolex as an example.  Why should you buy a Rolex?  Well, as the top watchmaker in the world, owning a Rolex has a bit of prestige added to it.  It’s expensive and says something about you.  If you own a Rolex, you’re pure class. It  tells the world you’re an important person.  So, what is Rolex’s message?  “A Rolex will never change the world.  We leave that to the people who wear them.”   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their message is, if you want to be a person of influence, a world changer, a SOMEBODY, then buy a Rolex.  This is what you buy to gain something. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) To avoid pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t purchase life, health, and car insurance because we have a ton of money laying around and have to buy SOMETHING.  And there’s nothing fun or sexy about an insurance policy.  What about home protection systems?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live Florida, you MUST have hurricane shutters.  Oh yes, there’s just something about a large, bulky, non-see-thru shutter to make your house look great!  (sarcasm) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about dental care?  Do you spend big money on a root canal because the dentist is a good friend of yours and you want to support his practice?  Probably not.  You get a root canal because you need one. You get the point. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t make the investment now, you will definitely feel the pain later!  We buy things to avoid feeling that pain. Take a look at this ad: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted works very hard.  Ted has everything. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted finally retires, as does his disability policy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted decides to go fishing.  Ted slips on a trout. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted loses everything.  Don’t be like Ted! </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad then shows Ted in a whole-body cast unable to move.  So why do we spent a lot of money on insurance?  It can almost seem like a waste of money until you’re in Ted’s position.  All it takes is one moment like that, while completely unprotected, to become overwhelmed with hospital bills and eventually losing everything you worked for. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take these two points into account, you should ask yourself what your message is.  What problem are you solving?  How can you make people’s lives better?  Why should anyone buy what you’re selling?  When you do this, it makes your marketing much more effective.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>EDUCATE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your target market on their gain or pain points and how they should depend on your product to soothe their needs. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>ENTERTAIN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your message, so you can hold their attention and intrigue them. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, your marketing should </span><b>ENGAGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them by making them think.  Get in their head by asking questions they are forced to answer.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the difference between simple marketing and good marketing.  Simple marketing just lets the world know your service or product exists, but it goes no further than that.  It may bring in a few sales, but what does it actually do to target and engage?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With good marketing, you are letting them know WHY they should buy and what you offer that no one else does.  How do you meet their needs in a way they can’t get from someone else down the street? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can market along these guidelines, your customers will be opening their wallets to you in no time!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for a reason to upgrade your website, this is it! Google announced earlier this week their intention to implement a new mobile search algorithm designed to give preference to faster sites.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google calls it the “Speed Update” and not everyone will feel the impact. If your site measures up in the speed department, you’ll likely see no change in how you’re ranked. According to the search engine giant, only a “small percentage” of sites, the ones who consistently rank low when it comes to loading times.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is yet another step by Google to improve user performance. It was only back in 2010 when they stated their full intention and focus was on desktop user speed, but it was only a few short years later in 2014 when the number of mobile users surpassed those who used the site on their desktop.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this shift in user preference, many industries have had to change the way they create and display ads. They suddenly had to be both desktop and mobile friendly, a lesson Facebook instantly learned when the mobile revolution took off. They weren’t prepared and had one of the worst online mobile apps on the internet.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing how quickly things were changing, Facebook, went into action and continues to find new ways to give mobile users the best experience possible. Now Google is jumping in and rewarding the sites with faster speeds.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is clear: if you’re not actively working to improve mobile reach, your competitors will get the traffic. It’s okay though. You have plenty of time to prepare your website for the change. The new algorithm isn’t set to be in place until July 2018.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, algorithms. Love them or hate them, where would your business be today without algorithms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the online world, algorithms make or break everything. And no, I’m not exaggerating. Try marketing on Facebook when they decide to change the way people see what you post. You can go from having amazing sales to barely getting a drop in the bucket, all because they decided to change their algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is the same way. Over the years, they’ve had different programs in place that marketers have learned to adapt into their marketing platform. In the beginning, Google was easy to use. They rarely updated any of their programming. If they made an update, you would have to change anything for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a technological age advanced and more people started filing their way in, Google needed to find a way to compete. The only way to do that is to constantly update your algorithms. It started with Google Coffee, which later became Panda and Penguin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s not so uncommon if Google updates several times a day rather than every few months. As much as it stings a lot of marketers, Google and Facebook do not care about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They care about the everyday user and ensuring that all search results cater to their needs. This is why you need to be careful if you do business online. It was recently confirmed by a Google employee, who has been with the company for over six years, that they STILL update Panda and Penguin despite moving on to a new algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to be aware of this as any unannounced changes will leave you in your website unprepared and you out of luck. It will disrupt your flow of traffic, drop your rankings on Google, and even mess with the accessibility of your site.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficult part is knowing when they start to tweak. Again, because these changes are purely for the consumer and everyday user, Google doesn’t feel the need to alert marketers of this change. In fact, it had been long believed that Panda and Penguin were obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that it’s been confirmed that they still update it from time to time, that should be a big enough of a warning to anyone in this space.</span></p>
