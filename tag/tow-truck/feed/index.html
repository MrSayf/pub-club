				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys it&#8217;s the middle of the week and I wanted to discuss some important paid search opportunities that you can find yourself in! We have recently been working with majority of tow truck owners and have seen a significant success &#8211; so much that we here at Pub Club Leads are willing to take on your account and show you how to get tows using Adwords for <strong>FREE!</strong></p>
<p>So if you know any tow truck companies or own one yourself, sign up! What have you got to lose? We&#8217;ll pay the first $100 of advertisement to prove to you this works! No AAA or insurance calls, all people looking for roadside assistance etc.</p>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>So let&#8217;s discuss the opportunities for anyone taking on clients of this vertical. The right way to structure the campaign and make it a success is going to be the click to call only for the campaign. This will work mainly because the user will be mobile and also in a stressful situation looking to call immediately to have relief. In addition this works well as some users prefer to &#8220;shop&#8221; around, but in this situation they tend to go with the first call quoted just to fix the problem.</p>
<p>You want to run in addition negative keywords associate to your campaign and structure accordingly such as &#8220;aaa&#8221;, &#8220;geico&#8221;, &#8220;all state&#8221;, and so forth. In addition you want your ad to have some call to action with perhaps inclusion of &#8220;24/7&#8221; or even some pricing included for better CTR&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Depending on your campaign you also need to select radius areas that each company services too. Perhaps some do more of the long distance towing which can be a vertical in its self! So hope this quick information helps and receiving calls at a cost of around no more than $6 each! We are currently doing quite the bit of volume in areas in the northern region due to the snow and accidents to be caused higher. Best of luck guys!</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. Tell me which verticals or campaigns you perhaps are keeping you stumped? Love to bring up an article about something the users would prefer! Thanks!</strong></em></p>
