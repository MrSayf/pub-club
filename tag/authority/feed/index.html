				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can know the basic definition of authority and desire to be an authority figure in your niche, but it’s something else entirely to know how to convert that knowledge into actual success.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, without the numbers to back up what you say you know, people won’t be too eager to follow you or recognize your authority status.  The fact that I’m an authority figure is a result of my knowledge bringing people (and businesses) to my door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me explain.  The four main pillars of online authority are </span><b>content marketing, social media presence, paid advertising, and publicity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Let’s break this down into individual chunks.   </span></p>
<p><b>Content marketing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most important and crucial aspects you need to master if you want to establish yourself as an authority figure.  As I sort of stated above, without regular content, you cease to be relevant. Any piece of content you publish online qualifies as content marketing, whether you publish regular blogs, articles, videos, or podcasts.  It doesn’t matter what you produce as long as it provides your audience quantifiable value. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also crucial to your success when establishing authority.  Many businesses live or die by how well they are able to communicate via social media.  As of right now, over 2 billion people worldwide use it, and that number is only expected to grow.  This means you need to figure out a way to use this technological advantage in an intelligent way. That means choosing the right social media outlets for your niche and being careful about the content you share. </span></p>
<p><b>Paid advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great for giving your website and social media accounts a bit of a push if you’re having a difficult time drawing traffic without it.  Again, if people haven’t heard of you, you’re not an authority. </span></p>
<p><b>And finally, publicity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re going to have to figure out new and creative ways to get your name out there.  There are plenty of ways to publicize yourself, both online and offline. Build up your social media profiles, attend high-profile events, give speeches, interview other experts in your niche, volunteer, and so much more.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on these four things, you become an authority (an expert) over time.  Most people begin to trust you and frequent your sites. That means that people will be beating a path to your door hoping to get your help and advice – and that can lead you to success in a number of different ways.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Authority to Your Benefit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a proven track record, you can start charging a consulting fee.  Some of what you used to give away for free to develop your authority status, you will now be charging for.  Set up a paid subscription service or even products/content that you will sell, like a book! Teach an online seminar or class.  Offer paid speaking engagements. These are just a few ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have information that people want, you can name your own price. I don’t mean to imply that it’s easy to become an authority – but it doesn’t have to be difficult, either. You’ll have to put in the time and effort to learn about your chosen topic and produce great content that people will want to consume and share. You can’t be an authority without that. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has ever decided to start their own business knows how difficult it can be to break through the noise and reach the top of their chosen industry.  In some circumstances, it can even seem impossible.  How do you reach your market with a blog when there are over 100 million blogs out there in cyberspace already?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is your website going to set you apart from your competitors when there are hundreds of millions of websites out there right this second?  Often, a lot of entrepreneurs give up their dreams of starting a business because the deck seems so incredibly stacked against them from the start.  It’s not a lack of passion or hard work, but of authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the work you’re putting in right now that will separate you from your competitors?  How are you differentiating yourself in your niche market that’s making the industry sit up and pay attention?  How are you reaching new clients and customers in a way that is unique and engaging?  The people are hungry for content, yet a lot of business owners do the bare minimum, hoping they take off like a rocket.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to expand into many different realms and markets, there will be no shortage of opportunities to come up with the next big idea, but also no shortage of competition.  Intense competition means you can either take a backseat and hope something turns viral or you can take the bull by its horns and step up your game.   </span></p>
<p><b>Being a Leader is Never Easy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming from a position of authority isn’t easy for everyone.  Some people seem to be born leaders while others are content holding back for the sake of self-preservation.  Being a leader means being vulnerable and open to attack.  Let’s use McDonalds as an example.  McDonald’s is at the very top of all the fast food restaurants, both in profits and the number of restaurants available.  They’ve cornered the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did McDonald&#8217;s get to the top?  Was it because they have the best hamburgers?  No.  The best customer service?  Not really.  The answer is, they provided value to their customers.  They were different and vastly stood out.  The same goes for becoming an authority figure.  You don’t have to be the world’s number one expert at what you do.  You just have to be good enough to continue growing and expanding while providing value in an underutilized market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is, it’s human nature to sink below the waterline and not be different from the crowd.  We fear confrontation and everyone else in your market will be trying to take you down.  Is McDonald&#8217;s the unhealthiest of all the fast food chains?  Again, not really.  There are other companies that have vastly greater portions, but because McDonalds is at the top, they get most the bad press.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being the leader is worth it.  Everyone around the world recognizes the Golden Arches.  Despite not being the best at what they do, they still reign as the true king of fast food sales, and it’s not even close.  In 2014, McDonalds brought in $35 billion in sales, while their closest competitor, Subway, only brought in $12 billion.  How did they do it, while overcoming the attacks that routinely come from competitors?  AUTHORITY. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Educate Your Audience with Content</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been paying any attention whatsoever to the leaders of many industries, there is one thing they do that really sets them apart from anyone else.  They don’t remain focused on their business goals exclusively.  They’re still pulling in big bucks, but they take advantage of their platform to step outside of their comfort zone.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve spent many years cultivating knowledge, gaining experience, and slaying obstacles, it’s one thing to use that to build your own business, but something else altogether to help lift other people out of the mud.  You see, a lot of these top people in their field gain almost a celebrity status.  How?  With content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them have a book.  They have blogs.  They’re constantly sharing different strategies they picked up in their own journey that helps someone else lower on the totem pole overcome a challenge in their own business.  And when that happens, what does it do for the guy on top?  What did he just create by helping others?  He gained respect and authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is truly how you become an industry leader. People flock to you and are more willing to open their wallets to you if they know you have something to offer. If you’re the person taking care of their needs, then you’re set for life.</span></p>
