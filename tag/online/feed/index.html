				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start this off with a bold statement: if you want to run a successful business, then you need to have an email marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to evolve and new marketing strategies are developed, one strategy has stood the test of time.  In fact, for the last decade, email marketing has ruled the online landscape.</span></p>
<p><b>Email is Better than Social Networking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s market, a lot of business owners focus on social networking.  It’s a great way to drive traffic, but it’s not the best way to make a buck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more active email accounts out there today than there are users on both Facebook and Twitter combined. When a potential customer opts-in, they’re giving you an opportunity to pitch to them directly. It’s personal and intimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook ads can be wasted money.  Statistically speaking, only 2% of your list will see your ad. It’s easy to scroll by and miss the information you want them to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send an email, it forces the customer to act.  They can’t just scroll by the email. They’re forced to look at it and decide whether it’s worth opening.</span></p>
<p><b>Crunching the Numbers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ROI for email marketing is $38 for every $1 spent.  That’s a return of 3,800%! You’re not going to find those kinds of numbers anywhere! The problem is, most business owners don’t know how to properly use email marketing to get that that type of return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It often takes a year or more of tinkering around, playing with keywords, studying headlines, building relationships, and delivering adequate content to increase your return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has the time or the money to strategize and wait for the results to start rolling in?  Is your email campaign actually costing you money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to tell your story and sell your brand in a way that gets customers to click and buy.</span></p>
<p><b>Having Your Own Cheat Sheet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to use email marketing the right way is like getting in shape.  You know what your goals are, but you don’t know how to get there. There’s nothing wrong with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s not designed for you and your goals, it’s a waste of time.  That’s why we exist. We’re successful at helping business owners take the next step and are here to give you that helping hand as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the benefits of being able to automate your campaign.  That means the money is still coming in, even while you’re sleeping!  If you want to go on vacation, that’s perfectly fine. Your campaign is still making money while you’re sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel that your email campaign is lackluster or that you’ve tried everything to improve your ROI, but nothing seems to work, Pub Club Leads can help get your campaign on track. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce sales hit new record highs for 2016 and 2017. The same will be true in 2018, especially as the economy continues to roll. With wages growing and people paying less in taxes, we can only expect the 2018 season, Christmas especially, to offer plenty of bonuses and surprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the growth of retail sales overall, 42% of it happened online. As each year passes, it would seem as if e-commerce sales have double digit increases. In 2016, e-commerce sales rose by 15.6%, coming in just shy of $400 billion. In 2017, online sales were 18% higher still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who’s been alive for the last 20 years can see how dramatically the Internet has changed the way we shop, work, and live. The Internet has conquered many industries and sent once proud and flourishing businesses running for the hills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember Blockbuster? Replaced by Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever been to Borders books? Replaced by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can write an entire case study based upon Amazon alone. They’re currently building fulfillment centers near every major US city and are developing advanced technologies, such as the use of drones, to make deliveries quicker and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to wonder if the advancement of Amazon is why most major retail stores, who were vastly unprepared for the Internet age, are quickly going out of business. Sales do not look good for the major brick-and-mortar outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the brick-and-mortar stores seem to be on the decline, retail sales overall jumped by 3.9%. How is that possible? Well, let’s just say there’s a reason why Walmart is now calling for an all-out war against Amazon for a piece of the online action. This comes as Walmart closes more stores and lays off more workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Now is the Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had one piece of advice for you, it would be to jump in right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are just now starting to get wise to the fact that they can make big money by taking advantage of the massive growth in e-commerce sales. New students in the game currently are raking in $5,000 to $10,000 each month. And that’s just the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce market is smoking hot and it is growing by leaps and bounds each year. During the holidays, Black Friday was the only day you could get amazing sales, but now there’s Cyber Monday to take advantage of the rapid increase of online sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to jump into something that not a whole lot of people know yet, but continues to be in a massive upward trend, it would be ecommerce. As larger chunks of retail sales are made online, you’ll be in the prime spot to take advantage of this niche for years to come.</span></p>
