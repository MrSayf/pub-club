				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start this off with a bold statement: if you want to run a successful business, then you need to have an email marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to evolve and new marketing strategies are developed, one strategy has stood the test of time.  In fact, for the last decade, email marketing has ruled the online landscape.</span></p>
<p><b>Email is Better than Social Networking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s market, a lot of business owners focus on social networking.  It’s a great way to drive traffic, but it’s not the best way to make a buck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more active email accounts out there today than there are users on both Facebook and Twitter combined. When a potential customer opts-in, they’re giving you an opportunity to pitch to them directly. It’s personal and intimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook ads can be wasted money.  Statistically speaking, only 2% of your list will see your ad. It’s easy to scroll by and miss the information you want them to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send an email, it forces the customer to act.  They can’t just scroll by the email. They’re forced to look at it and decide whether it’s worth opening.</span></p>
<p><b>Crunching the Numbers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ROI for email marketing is $38 for every $1 spent.  That’s a return of 3,800%! You’re not going to find those kinds of numbers anywhere! The problem is, most business owners don’t know how to properly use email marketing to get that that type of return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It often takes a year or more of tinkering around, playing with keywords, studying headlines, building relationships, and delivering adequate content to increase your return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has the time or the money to strategize and wait for the results to start rolling in?  Is your email campaign actually costing you money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to tell your story and sell your brand in a way that gets customers to click and buy.</span></p>
<p><b>Having Your Own Cheat Sheet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to use email marketing the right way is like getting in shape.  You know what your goals are, but you don’t know how to get there. There’s nothing wrong with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s not designed for you and your goals, it’s a waste of time.  That’s why we exist. We’re successful at helping business owners take the next step and are here to give you that helping hand as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the benefits of being able to automate your campaign.  That means the money is still coming in, even while you’re sleeping!  If you want to go on vacation, that’s perfectly fine. Your campaign is still making money while you’re sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel that your email campaign is lackluster or that you’ve tried everything to improve your ROI, but nothing seems to work, Pub Club Leads can help get your campaign on track. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce sales hit new record highs for 2016 and 2017. The same will be true in 2018, especially as the economy continues to roll. With wages growing and people paying less in taxes, we can only expect the 2018 season, Christmas especially, to offer plenty of bonuses and surprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the growth of retail sales overall, 42% of it happened online. As each year passes, it would seem as if e-commerce sales have double digit increases. In 2016, e-commerce sales rose by 15.6%, coming in just shy of $400 billion. In 2017, online sales were 18% higher still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who’s been alive for the last 20 years can see how dramatically the Internet has changed the way we shop, work, and live. The Internet has conquered many industries and sent once proud and flourishing businesses running for the hills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember Blockbuster? Replaced by Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever been to Borders books? Replaced by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can write an entire case study based upon Amazon alone. They’re currently building fulfillment centers near every major US city and are developing advanced technologies, such as the use of drones, to make deliveries quicker and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to wonder if the advancement of Amazon is why most major retail stores, who were vastly unprepared for the Internet age, are quickly going out of business. Sales do not look good for the major brick-and-mortar outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the brick-and-mortar stores seem to be on the decline, retail sales overall jumped by 3.9%. How is that possible? Well, let’s just say there’s a reason why Walmart is now calling for an all-out war against Amazon for a piece of the online action. This comes as Walmart closes more stores and lays off more workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Now is the Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had one piece of advice for you, it would be to jump in right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are just now starting to get wise to the fact that they can make big money by taking advantage of the massive growth in e-commerce sales. New students in the game currently are raking in $5,000 to $10,000 each month. And that’s just the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce market is smoking hot and it is growing by leaps and bounds each year. During the holidays, Black Friday was the only day you could get amazing sales, but now there’s Cyber Monday to take advantage of the rapid increase of online sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to jump into something that not a whole lot of people know yet, but continues to be in a massive upward trend, it would be ecommerce. As larger chunks of retail sales are made online, you’ll be in the prime spot to take advantage of this niche for years to come.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of marketing truths that seem to fight against human nature. When a lot of new marketers and business owners try to advertise, get the word out, and build authority in their niche, they think about the big picture all at once. When they create ads, they make the mistake of trying to blast their message to everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, 90% of new online businesses go under. One of the biggest reasons why include trying to do too much and being everything to everyone. You’re going to waste money throwing a handful of spaghetti at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. The only way to set yourself apart is by narrowing down your niche and your speciality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don’t Be a Jack-of-all-Trades</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the fastest ways to become an industry leader is by choosing a niche and sticking with it.  You might think it’s an obvious statement, but you’d be surprised by how many people are either stuck and don’t know where to begin or work in general terms, not really choosing one niche, but many.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t be an authority figure in a single market if you consider yourself a jack-of-all-trades.  Dabbling in multiple markets makes sure you stay mediocre because your attention is diverted to different projects at once.  Instead, focus on one project and stick with it.  Not only does it make things simpler for you, you can get a faster start building from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><b>Education-Based Marketing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we attempt to be the best, we often see everyone else as competition, as if there’s only room for one at the top. This is a very cold way of getting things done, as you’re missing out on greater opportunities to reach out and build a community.  Our world is changing.  As we become more globalist in the way we live and do business, it’s no longer feasible to cut anyone out.  Your greatest consumers may very well be your competition.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet has also changed the way we do sales.  Consumers expect immediate access in this digital-driven age.  If you have no way of building trust, you’re not going to get far.  Education-based marketing builds trust quicker than someone who uses traditional marketing.  Rather than using the same tired sales pitches, use blogs, books, and other types of content to educate and give the type of information to help buyers make the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then use this educational-based content and get it published in various outlets.  If you can tell your customers that you’re a published author in the field of marketing, or that you’ve had an article you wrote featured in a top magazine, you have instant authority.  They will feel like they can trust you and are more eager to open their wallet over someone with no content to share at all. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Doing One Thing Really Well</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about restaurants for a moment. The local pizza shop also sells burgers on the cheap. If you really want a great burger, do you go to those guys, or the actual burger shop down the road that’s a bit more expensive? You know exactly who to go to if you want a great burger. The pizza shop who tries to do everything most likely doesn’t even have the best pizza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because they’re focused on trying to do too much. They don’t put out the best product and shouldn’t be considered a leader in the industry. They might make a few bucks on their cheap burgers, but they won’t be the company you think about when you’re really craving a juicy cheeseburger. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business works the same way. By creating educational-based marketing and focusing on that one area of expertise, you can be the ‘go-to’ business your customers flock to. They’re eager to learn and improve their lives, so no matter what you do, they’ll come running back, willing to open their wallets again and again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out a specific niche and start from there.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is essential. If people don’t know you exist, how can find you?  And if they can’t find you, you’re simply not making the sales you need to be successful.  While some marketing will offer results, the right kind of marketing can be the difference between mediocre sales and taking off like a rocket. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, good marketing is like a candle in a dark cave.  It will illuminate not just your product, but your entire empire.  Your eyes and your attention will be drawn towards the light!  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right type of marketing,  doesn’t take much to convince your audience that they NEED your product or service, nor can they live without it.  It resonates with them deep down inside.  It identifies their needs.  It educates them and promises to make them better at life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Marketing Basics</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the big secret for marketing the right way?  It’s all about targeting the right crowd.  Your marketing should attract your target audience, not every single person you can get the message to.  Think about it like this: a bug zapper was designed to attract bugs.  That’s what it was built to do.  It’s not meant to attract kangaroos or crocodiles.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources are finite and attempting to attract people who do not fit the target audience is just like setting your money on fire.  Why?  It goes back to knowing the basics.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People buy things for two reasons: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) For gain. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They want to raise their personal brand and improve their image.  To impress.  Maybe it’s the girl they have a crush on or to secure a promotion.  Maybe it entertains them in ways other products cannot.  The purchase is made with one thing in mind: If I buy this product, what will it do for me?   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often do and buy things because it improves the way other people see us.  How many times have you purchased an item simply to build a relationship with someone?  Whatever we purchase, it’s done with gain in mind.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Rolex as an example.  Why should you buy a Rolex?  Well, as the top watchmaker in the world, owning a Rolex has a bit of prestige added to it.  It’s expensive and says something about you.  If you own a Rolex, you’re pure class. It  tells the world you’re an important person.  So, what is Rolex’s message?  “A Rolex will never change the world.  We leave that to the people who wear them.”   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their message is, if you want to be a person of influence, a world changer, a SOMEBODY, then buy a Rolex.  This is what you buy to gain something. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) To avoid pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t purchase life, health, and car insurance because we have a ton of money laying around and have to buy SOMETHING.  And there’s nothing fun or sexy about an insurance policy.  What about home protection systems?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live Florida, you MUST have hurricane shutters.  Oh yes, there’s just something about a large, bulky, non-see-thru shutter to make your house look great!  (sarcasm) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about dental care?  Do you spend big money on a root canal because the dentist is a good friend of yours and you want to support his practice?  Probably not.  You get a root canal because you need one. You get the point. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t make the investment now, you will definitely feel the pain later!  We buy things to avoid feeling that pain. Take a look at this ad: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted works very hard.  Ted has everything. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted finally retires, as does his disability policy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted decides to go fishing.  Ted slips on a trout. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted loses everything.  Don’t be like Ted! </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad then shows Ted in a whole-body cast unable to move.  So why do we spent a lot of money on insurance?  It can almost seem like a waste of money until you’re in Ted’s position.  All it takes is one moment like that, while completely unprotected, to become overwhelmed with hospital bills and eventually losing everything you worked for. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take these two points into account, you should ask yourself what your message is.  What problem are you solving?  How can you make people’s lives better?  Why should anyone buy what you’re selling?  When you do this, it makes your marketing much more effective.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>EDUCATE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your target market on their gain or pain points and how they should depend on your product to soothe their needs. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>ENTERTAIN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your message, so you can hold their attention and intrigue them. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, your marketing should </span><b>ENGAGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them by making them think.  Get in their head by asking questions they are forced to answer.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the difference between simple marketing and good marketing.  Simple marketing just lets the world know your service or product exists, but it goes no further than that.  It may bring in a few sales, but what does it actually do to target and engage?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With good marketing, you are letting them know WHY they should buy and what you offer that no one else does.  How do you meet their needs in a way they can’t get from someone else down the street? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can market along these guidelines, your customers will be opening their wallets to you in no time!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are incredibly complex creatures who rely mostly on non-verbal communication. Words can communicate only so much, which is why they say a picture is worth a thousand of them. Nothing can impact your mood more than what you are able to see, which is why advertisers know the true power of compelling images and how they impact buying power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google knows this as well, which is why they’re currently beta testing a new ad feature called Visual Sitelinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Sergey Alakov Tweeted an image of a screenshot he took while browsing on Google. The text ad, urging users to check out their site for a fast, no credit needed approval for a car loan, was accompanied by a picture of a nice truck to the right of the ad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the image work? I can personally attest that the second I saw the truck next to the ad and associated with it. I wanted that truck! That’s how powerful a simple image can be, which is why Google is currently working to bring this to us full time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reply to Search Engine Land, a Google spokesperson said, “We’re always testing new ways to improve our experience for our advertisers and users, but don’t have anything specific to announce right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads have a 40% better response rate if they have an image associate with them, so the fact that Google is still testing ways to better utilize images in their search engine reveals a lot about their priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will this help improve your reach? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that magical time of year again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, the one where people around the world are eager to buy, buy, buy. To a seller, that makes the holiday season truly magical. But to capitalize on the heightened frenzy of holiday shopping, the seller must be at the top of their game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In past years, it was easier to make a few bucks with paid ads as online sales shared a smaller portion of overall profits. Brick and mortar still dominated the landscape and it was impossible to compete with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then something started to happen. It shocked the marketing world, including me! I never thought I’d see the day when Walmart was fighting and clawing its way back to relevancy, but Amazon has sure put retail in its place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will only tell if empty Walmart stores will dot the landscape, just as you occasionally see with Kmart and Circuit City. Innovation and simplicity is here to rule the day, and no one will be able to stop the momentum.</span></p>
<p><b>The Digital Shift is Happening</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to TechCrunch, online sales are up almost 20% from last year, hitting a new record of $2.87 billion. The numbers Amazon raked in were so astonishing, I had to double check several sources to make sure it was right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About HALF of all online sales went to Amazon, reportedly inhaling $1 billion in a 24-hour span.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have so many billions flowing through internet, sellers are finding no shortage of competition flooding in, hoping to take advantage. According to a Twitter #PPCCHAT poll, 61% of marketers felt the pressure from increased competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at the Google insights, you can clearly see that all the numbers are up for the year, including mobile traffic. Yes, more people are buying Christmas gifts on their mobile device!</span></p>
<p><b>How Can You Compete?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With competitors flooding the market, you might be asking yourself how to keep your sales flowing. It might require you to change your tactics, including personalizing your ad campaigns for Christmas sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many marketers get caught up in the daily flow of their business and completely forget about preparing ahead of time for the holidays. This is especially true for new marketers who are fully engaged in getting everything up and running smoothly. It also means if you prepare early for the holiday season, you’re ahead of the influx of new competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas season is chocked full of emotional buyers who buy gifts just to see the smile on their loved one’s face. Take advantage of it. Google trends reveal that people start thinking about buying as far back as August! Just the anticipation for the upcoming season is enough.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see this not only requested by certain clients, but also asked by many marketers this question. The quick answer is &#8211; NO! Marketing for search advertising on Adwords will rarely if at all for another business to find yours. There are other means to advertise to assist in better situations for the B2B market.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong there are certain situations that it may be beneficial to advertise through search. Search Engine Land did a great recent example as to why this may be effective, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/5-successful-b2b-adwords-best-practices-for-any-company-277308"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B2B Practices</span></em></a>. While this may have some good points, for most cases this still wouldn&#8217;t be the BEST option with your client&#8217;s money to advertise to another business.</p>
<p>One good example of an exception is funding and monies, like merchant cash advance. A lot of small businesses will search for funds needed for their business. In my experience with MCA this works quite well if you cross vertical it by people looking for business credit cards and explaining the benefits that MCA can be a more affordable route with a loan and lower interest.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the solution I propose?</strong></p>
<p>Well simple start with looking into ways to advertise specifically to your audience. And most ways of doing so can be through either Google Display, Facebook Ads, even Native advertising. I cannot tell you how helpful it is to specifically target the users you are looking for (small business owners, CEO&#8217;s, manufacturers, etc.) and removing that initial wasteful spend without learning what is and isn&#8217;t working for your campaign. Many of our succesful B2B campaigns work primarily in these areas and have had a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference in B2B and B2C with Adwords and other marketing platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Well aside from the obvious answer the initial biggest difference is understanding the KPI and ROAS goals. With B2B you can afford to receive a much higher cost on both than being a B2C market. And with that being a significant difference it allows to you identify and explore more. In addition majority of the budget that you are given will be a lot more with a B2B market &#8211; If it isn&#8217;t then RUN away and give the proper expectation to your potential client.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are having success with Adwords in your B2B market and plays an easier role than I am describing! I would love to know which!?</p>
