				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can know the basic definition of authority and desire to be an authority figure in your niche, but it’s something else entirely to know how to convert that knowledge into actual success.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, without the numbers to back up what you say you know, people won’t be too eager to follow you or recognize your authority status.  The fact that I’m an authority figure is a result of my knowledge bringing people (and businesses) to my door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me explain.  The four main pillars of online authority are </span><b>content marketing, social media presence, paid advertising, and publicity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Let’s break this down into individual chunks.   </span></p>
<p><b>Content marketing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most important and crucial aspects you need to master if you want to establish yourself as an authority figure.  As I sort of stated above, without regular content, you cease to be relevant. Any piece of content you publish online qualifies as content marketing, whether you publish regular blogs, articles, videos, or podcasts.  It doesn’t matter what you produce as long as it provides your audience quantifiable value. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also crucial to your success when establishing authority.  Many businesses live or die by how well they are able to communicate via social media.  As of right now, over 2 billion people worldwide use it, and that number is only expected to grow.  This means you need to figure out a way to use this technological advantage in an intelligent way. That means choosing the right social media outlets for your niche and being careful about the content you share. </span></p>
<p><b>Paid advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great for giving your website and social media accounts a bit of a push if you’re having a difficult time drawing traffic without it.  Again, if people haven’t heard of you, you’re not an authority. </span></p>
<p><b>And finally, publicity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re going to have to figure out new and creative ways to get your name out there.  There are plenty of ways to publicize yourself, both online and offline. Build up your social media profiles, attend high-profile events, give speeches, interview other experts in your niche, volunteer, and so much more.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on these four things, you become an authority (an expert) over time.  Most people begin to trust you and frequent your sites. That means that people will be beating a path to your door hoping to get your help and advice – and that can lead you to success in a number of different ways.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Authority to Your Benefit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a proven track record, you can start charging a consulting fee.  Some of what you used to give away for free to develop your authority status, you will now be charging for.  Set up a paid subscription service or even products/content that you will sell, like a book! Teach an online seminar or class.  Offer paid speaking engagements. These are just a few ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have information that people want, you can name your own price. I don’t mean to imply that it’s easy to become an authority – but it doesn’t have to be difficult, either. You’ll have to put in the time and effort to learn about your chosen topic and produce great content that people will want to consume and share. You can’t be an authority without that. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Bill Gates who once coined the term “content is king.” If you run an online business, you know how crucial it is for you to get your content out in front of as many eyes as possible. Not only do you want to grow the popularity of your content, you will also want to provide your audience with nourishing, sustaining content they desire.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a high ranking on Google, there are a lot of different hoops, strategies, and factors you will have to jump through. It can be quite overwhelming to understand, especially for a marketer who just wants to get their content out there. So, let us take look at one of those strategies in particular: internal links.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The Power of the Internal Link</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal link is essentially just a hyperlink that allows you to connect different pages of your website. These make navigating your site a lot easier. And when you have content that is easily accessible from other parts of your website, it allows your audience to spend more time on your site. They end up clicking on all kinds of different things, which is great for you.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a ranking power within your website. If you have a lot of pages and posts that link to each other, and your audience is clicking on things, your ranking will improve. It also helps bots find your ‘obscure’ content and learn how to better understand how your website works.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone is enjoying your content, and you have a proper internal linking structure within that content, they’re going to spend a lot more time combing through your website, clicking on things, and getting to know you better. The amount of time people spend on your website is a huge factor in how your ranking is determined.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Making Internal Links a Part of Your SEO Strategy</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal linking only works if you have a lot of relevant content on your site. Therefore, it is so important to have a content strategy prepared to help with your Google ranking. A lot of marketers and online business owners invest heavily in making sure they are producing content on a regular basis for this very reason.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to remember not to just throw any links into your content as you see fit. It must serve a purpose and the relevant to that specific piece. Think of it like a roadmap. You want your readers to go from A to B to C and to reach a positive conclusion about what you offer. Just throwing any link in there might confuse or throw off some readers and cause more harm.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Creating Cornerstone Content</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind cornerstone content is having maybe 4 to 5 different pieces that really define who you are and what you do. These are the authority pieces everyone should read. They are also the pieces that you want to rank highly on Google. No matter the different offshoot types of content you want to create, they should always link back to one of the cornerstone pieces.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this is to define exactly what you are about. You might have a variety of different pieces of content that might not be so clear to some readers, so if they can link back to the cornerstone content, it will be more obvious to them what you stand for and what your message is. They also should not compete with the other types of content on your page.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must also remember not to forget about repurposing old content, so make them a part of your internal linking SEO strategy. By doing so, it will help Google see that the old works are still relevant, helping your site’s ranking even further.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is king, there is no doubt about it. Making sure all your content has internal links will give your ranking a boost and increase the number of people who will find your stuff. Not only that, but it provides your audience with more information, which they will often appreciate. Just by doing this one step, you should see immediate results.</span></p>
