				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is essential. If people don’t know you exist, how can find you?  And if they can’t find you, you’re simply not making the sales you need to be successful.  While some marketing will offer results, the right kind of marketing can be the difference between mediocre sales and taking off like a rocket. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, good marketing is like a candle in a dark cave.  It will illuminate not just your product, but your entire empire.  Your eyes and your attention will be drawn towards the light!  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right type of marketing,  doesn’t take much to convince your audience that they NEED your product or service, nor can they live without it.  It resonates with them deep down inside.  It identifies their needs.  It educates them and promises to make them better at life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Marketing Basics</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the big secret for marketing the right way?  It’s all about targeting the right crowd.  Your marketing should attract your target audience, not every single person you can get the message to.  Think about it like this: a bug zapper was designed to attract bugs.  That’s what it was built to do.  It’s not meant to attract kangaroos or crocodiles.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources are finite and attempting to attract people who do not fit the target audience is just like setting your money on fire.  Why?  It goes back to knowing the basics.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People buy things for two reasons: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) For gain. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They want to raise their personal brand and improve their image.  To impress.  Maybe it’s the girl they have a crush on or to secure a promotion.  Maybe it entertains them in ways other products cannot.  The purchase is made with one thing in mind: If I buy this product, what will it do for me?   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often do and buy things because it improves the way other people see us.  How many times have you purchased an item simply to build a relationship with someone?  Whatever we purchase, it’s done with gain in mind.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Rolex as an example.  Why should you buy a Rolex?  Well, as the top watchmaker in the world, owning a Rolex has a bit of prestige added to it.  It’s expensive and says something about you.  If you own a Rolex, you’re pure class. It  tells the world you’re an important person.  So, what is Rolex’s message?  “A Rolex will never change the world.  We leave that to the people who wear them.”   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their message is, if you want to be a person of influence, a world changer, a SOMEBODY, then buy a Rolex.  This is what you buy to gain something. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) To avoid pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t purchase life, health, and car insurance because we have a ton of money laying around and have to buy SOMETHING.  And there’s nothing fun or sexy about an insurance policy.  What about home protection systems?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live Florida, you MUST have hurricane shutters.  Oh yes, there’s just something about a large, bulky, non-see-thru shutter to make your house look great!  (sarcasm) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about dental care?  Do you spend big money on a root canal because the dentist is a good friend of yours and you want to support his practice?  Probably not.  You get a root canal because you need one. You get the point. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t make the investment now, you will definitely feel the pain later!  We buy things to avoid feeling that pain. Take a look at this ad: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted works very hard.  Ted has everything. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted finally retires, as does his disability policy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted decides to go fishing.  Ted slips on a trout. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted loses everything.  Don’t be like Ted! </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad then shows Ted in a whole-body cast unable to move.  So why do we spent a lot of money on insurance?  It can almost seem like a waste of money until you’re in Ted’s position.  All it takes is one moment like that, while completely unprotected, to become overwhelmed with hospital bills and eventually losing everything you worked for. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take these two points into account, you should ask yourself what your message is.  What problem are you solving?  How can you make people’s lives better?  Why should anyone buy what you’re selling?  When you do this, it makes your marketing much more effective.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>EDUCATE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your target market on their gain or pain points and how they should depend on your product to soothe their needs. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>ENTERTAIN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your message, so you can hold their attention and intrigue them. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, your marketing should </span><b>ENGAGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them by making them think.  Get in their head by asking questions they are forced to answer.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the difference between simple marketing and good marketing.  Simple marketing just lets the world know your service or product exists, but it goes no further than that.  It may bring in a few sales, but what does it actually do to target and engage?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With good marketing, you are letting them know WHY they should buy and what you offer that no one else does.  How do you meet their needs in a way they can’t get from someone else down the street? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can market along these guidelines, your customers will be opening their wallets to you in no time!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see this not only requested by certain clients, but also asked by many marketers this question. The quick answer is &#8211; NO! Marketing for search advertising on Adwords will rarely if at all for another business to find yours. There are other means to advertise to assist in better situations for the B2B market.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong there are certain situations that it may be beneficial to advertise through search. Search Engine Land did a great recent example as to why this may be effective, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/5-successful-b2b-adwords-best-practices-for-any-company-277308"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B2B Practices</span></em></a>. While this may have some good points, for most cases this still wouldn&#8217;t be the BEST option with your client&#8217;s money to advertise to another business.</p>
<p>One good example of an exception is funding and monies, like merchant cash advance. A lot of small businesses will search for funds needed for their business. In my experience with MCA this works quite well if you cross vertical it by people looking for business credit cards and explaining the benefits that MCA can be a more affordable route with a loan and lower interest.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the solution I propose?</strong></p>
<p>Well simple start with looking into ways to advertise specifically to your audience. And most ways of doing so can be through either Google Display, Facebook Ads, even Native advertising. I cannot tell you how helpful it is to specifically target the users you are looking for (small business owners, CEO&#8217;s, manufacturers, etc.) and removing that initial wasteful spend without learning what is and isn&#8217;t working for your campaign. Many of our succesful B2B campaigns work primarily in these areas and have had a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference in B2B and B2C with Adwords and other marketing platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Well aside from the obvious answer the initial biggest difference is understanding the KPI and ROAS goals. With B2B you can afford to receive a much higher cost on both than being a B2C market. And with that being a significant difference it allows to you identify and explore more. In addition majority of the budget that you are given will be a lot more with a B2B market &#8211; If it isn&#8217;t then RUN away and give the proper expectation to your potential client.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are having success with Adwords in your B2B market and plays an easier role than I am describing! I would love to know which!?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most discussed about topics and questions I am asked quite frequently is about landing pages and how it effects their paid search performance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Outdated Landing Page.</strong> The most issue I normally see with poor performance pages is the coding and outdated the page can be. I normally try to push for our clients and internally to go with word press sites. You would be surprised I still see websites that are in flash. (Which is horrible in all cases.)</p>
<p>&#8211; Be sure to have an update landing page preferred WordPress.<br />
&#8211; Optimize web page speed.<br />
&#8211; A/B test all landers with variable using sites like Unbounce, Optimizely, Click funnels.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tracking Codes.</strong> Some clients majority of the time do not have any tracking at all &#8211; and even if they did have the tracking codes the issue was that the code(s) were not properly placed where they needed to be. As we all know if you wish to use re-marketing you want all the pages to have the code on it. And any tracking for conversions need to be placed either through actionable items synced with Analytics or a specific page. In certain cases we have conversions for talk time durations which can only be set up in the Ad Words account itself.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking for conversions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking on any platform including Adwords is enabled for duration of talk times etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Form Fills.</strong> Even with form fills enabled for our client it tends to look more of a contact page, this is not the right approach. We like to differentiate it by having a form box with the required questions for a potential lead. Even at times we may even do a step-by-step questionnaire to keep the user active in answering. Examples would be drop downs, drag bars for approximate debt, and more.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too busy.</strong> This can be a huge difference in advertising your home page or lander. And by the term, &#8220;too busy&#8221; is just sometimes too much information can deter the user from getting them to do the required field of actually filling out a form or call. Don&#8217;t let this happen to your advertising. Make an objective for the user to do and provide an easy way to take action. Every time we either have the form readily visible for the user to fill even with a click to call option on both the bottom of form and top right of the header. Even some images of a phone next to the number provides a quicker response and understanding like an emoji.</p>
<p>These are my top issues I notice, what do you notice with landing pages with your clients? Let&#8217;s discuss!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys it&#8217;s the middle of the week and I wanted to discuss some important paid search opportunities that you can find yourself in! We have recently been working with majority of tow truck owners and have seen a significant success &#8211; so much that we here at Pub Club Leads are willing to take on your account and show you how to get tows using Adwords for <strong>FREE!</strong></p>
<p>So if you know any tow truck companies or own one yourself, sign up! What have you got to lose? We&#8217;ll pay the first $100 of advertisement to prove to you this works! No AAA or insurance calls, all people looking for roadside assistance etc.</p>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>So let&#8217;s discuss the opportunities for anyone taking on clients of this vertical. The right way to structure the campaign and make it a success is going to be the click to call only for the campaign. This will work mainly because the user will be mobile and also in a stressful situation looking to call immediately to have relief. In addition this works well as some users prefer to &#8220;shop&#8221; around, but in this situation they tend to go with the first call quoted just to fix the problem.</p>
<p>You want to run in addition negative keywords associate to your campaign and structure accordingly such as &#8220;aaa&#8221;, &#8220;geico&#8221;, &#8220;all state&#8221;, and so forth. In addition you want your ad to have some call to action with perhaps inclusion of &#8220;24/7&#8221; or even some pricing included for better CTR&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Depending on your campaign you also need to select radius areas that each company services too. Perhaps some do more of the long distance towing which can be a vertical in its self! So hope this quick information helps and receiving calls at a cost of around no more than $6 each! We are currently doing quite the bit of volume in areas in the northern region due to the snow and accidents to be caused higher. Best of luck guys!</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. Tell me which verticals or campaigns you perhaps are keeping you stumped? Love to bring up an article about something the users would prefer! Thanks!</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone it&#8217;s Alex with Pub Club Leads! I wanted to discuss some of the most common mistakes I see when diving into AdWords accounts. Hopefully this article will allow you to ensure not to make the same mistake, or consider this a checklist for your account structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Paying for negative keywords or not adding negative keywords in the search terms.</strong> This is by the far the biggest issue I notice in a lot of accounts. It&#8217;s a shame but not many people are aware about it or feel if they have the right match type it will eliminate any wasteful spend &#8211; not true!<br />
Be sure on a daily or every other day to look to see what the search terms are and add accordingly for any negative keywords you DON&#8217;T want to show up for.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Not using extensions.</strong> Majority of these extensions not only improve your CTR and quality score, but it&#8217;s &#8220;FREE REAL ESTATE&#8221;. Use as many extensions as you can for your business &#8211; majority of the time it will make sense!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-250 aligncenter" src="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate-300x225.jpg" alt="Free Real Estate" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate-300x225.jpg 300w, http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Not tracking conversions.</strong> I am sure a lot of us paid specialists can agree that not tracking your conversions is basically throwing money out the window! This is seen a mass majority of the time and it&#8217;s a shame I still see it to this day! But I implore anyone to go to the tools tab and click on conversions to begin tracking, even if you cannot &#8211; surely your web developer can!</p>

<p><b>5. Not Using Bid Adjustments: </b>This is huge! For many campaigns some get a lower CPA on mobile then they do on desktop devices. If this were true, change your bid adjustment by certain percentage that makes sense. If you really want to go all out, then create a mobile campaign only. But not using this bid option is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Too many keywords in one adgroup.</strong> This is the funniest part of the whole article honestly, because I literally tally the most keywords I have ever seen in an adgroup and so far that number is literally over 150! Please use best practice and try to keep it anywhere to maximum of 10-15! If you want to go the hardest route, some believe to go one keyword variant per adgroup &#8211; this could work out well especially if trying to optimize per keyword on call duration conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Google Adwords Express.</strong> I really cannot elaborate too much on this as this could be the #1 sin in paid search ever! Please do not use this feature ever, even if Google themselves recommend it! You need control and the best way to do that is using Google&#8217;s Adword platform as a whole. Be sure any campaign you create especially search to use all features. You want to be able to use manual bidding &#8211; it&#8217;ll be important long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary hopefully you are not a victim on any of these top mistakes that I notice majority of the time. If you feel you ever need assistance on your paid search or just have a general question feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:alex.heme@pubclubleads.com">alex.heme@pubclubleads.com</a>. Have a great week everyone!</p>
