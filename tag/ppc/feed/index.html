				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the most part, technology hasn’t changed the way humans have lived for most of our history on this planet.  Think about it for a second.  For thousands of years, what mode of transportation have our ancestors shared?  Horses.  Wagons.  It wasn’t until 1885 when Karl Benz invented the first car.  Look at how far we’ve come just in the last 100+ years.</p>
<p>In 1914, if you wanted to travel to Asia from the United States, it would’ve taken you 40 days.  Now, we have supersonic jets that will cross the Pacific in about 14 hours. As of this writing, they are currently researching and building jets that can take you from New York to London in about 20 minutes.  </p>
<p>Travel is just the beginning.  Think about all the advancements in medicine, hygiene, genetics, vaccines, food, surgical care, housing, consumer products, buying and selling, radio, TV, video games, electricity, heat/air conditioning, refrigeration, telephones, space travel, cameras, and computers.  These are all relatively new advancements that have changed the course of human history forever.</p>
<p>These advances haven’t only impacted the way we live and how we entertain ourselves, but it also changed the business world forever.  Thanks to the internet, we’re now a highly-connected species.  Who would’ve ever imagined having the ability to video chat with someone instantly who lived on the other side of the planet?  </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Founder of Facebook, boasts having connected nearly 2 billion people with his platform.  That’s 2 billion people who are spread out across the globe, but thanks to the internet, they might as well be in the next room.  This type of connectivity has allowed for major changes in how we do business.</p>
<p>Consider that for thousands of years, up until about 15-20 years ago, the strongest industries were involved in natural resources, like coal, oil, wood, and mining.  Suddenly, the internet goes commercial, connecting the world, and changing how companies compete globally.  The top companies in the world are now tech giants, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.</p>
<p>CEOs now make billions on ideas, instead of commodities.</p>
<p>As the world continues to get smaller, we are becoming more of a melting pot.  Cultures are mixing, as are languages and lifestyles.  When you have a variety of different people and languages living in one area, it can complicate the infrastructure of government, business, schools, and even the economy</p>
<p>As a budding entrepreneur, the secret to success is tapping into this resource and knowing how to use technology to your advantage. There’s no other medium where you can reach across the globe and advertise your products to millions than social media. You’ll have to learn about demographics, scaling ads, and how to reach an audience.</p>
<p>If you want your website to get traffic, you’ll need to know how to utilize SEO in your content. You’ll need to design a website that’s fast, efficient, and catches the eye.</p>
<p>The toughest part for new online entrepreneurs to understand is how quickly the tech is changing. It seems as if new stuff comes out every other day. If you struggle with keeping up, or you have no idea where to start, you have two options:</p>
<p>1) Take several years and try to figure it out yourself.<br />
2) Find a company who already knows how to do it and hire them.</p>
<p>Agencies like Pub Club Leads are experts helping people get on the right track right out of the gate. The last thing you want to do is start your business already behind. It costs new entrepreneurs several years and many thousands of dollars’ worth of failed attempts before they get a grasp on what they’re doing.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re doing, your best bet is to ask for help. It doesn’t matter if you need a little bit of help, or a lot of it. All it takes is a single wrongly-worded ad to keep your sales down.</p>
<p>The technology revolution isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Right now is the perfect time to pursue that business idea, but don’t do it alone. Let Pub Club Leads guide you through the process and give you the edge you need to outsmart your competitors and make the kind of money you always dreamed you’d make working from home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one thing to create an ad and start advertising on Facebook, but it’s something else entirely to track all the numbers you get in return and apply it for the ultimate success of your business.  The numbers might not match the goals you had in mind. Or maybe those goals have changed. What do you do now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, every advertising campaign will need to be tweaked at some point.  Rarely does anyone get it right the very first time, especially when they’re first starting and aren’t too familiar with their audience yet.  You can make some wild (or even educated) guesses, but you won’t truly know how the market will react until you’re out there in the thick of it.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight, so even if your ads are running smoothly, there’s room for improvement.  You’re going to have to optimise your campaign and scale your ads. First, let’s take a look at ways you can better define your objectives to create the best plan possible. </span></p>
<p><b>What Are Your Goals?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing your ads doesn’t start after you’ve already created them, but before.  You need a good targeting strategy and goals planned beforehand. How will you know if the ads are performing well if you don’t have your goals mapped out?  This is your only measure of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need a good understanding of what Facebook is. It’s a social networking site.  When people jump on Facebook, they’re doing it interact with friends and hang out. They hop on to relax and clear the mind after a long day.  That’s why selling can involve some complex processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook being committed to sharing only user-relevant content, you need to find a way to brand yourself in a way that’s relevant to potential customers.  Do your advertisement fit neatly on their Newsfeed? Is your content organic? This will ultimately matter, as you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal when it comes to advertising on Facebook is brand awareness.  As we covered previously, Facebook isn’t great with direct sales. It will take time, targeting, and energy as you develop relationships with your potential customers.  To get any kind of traction on Facebook, you must be content-driven. Most products or services are ‘discovered’ on Facebook through content. </span></p>
<p><b>Split Testing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you spend time and money working out your ad campaigns, your job isn’t done.  The most recommended method to determining what works and what doesn’t is by split-testing.  Split testing (or A/B testing) is a way to determine what graphics, copy, imagines, headlines, and call-to-actions drive more of your targeted audience to convert.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to know off hand which ads will work.  You can have all the right stuff together, but the call-to-action needs more work or there’s an off word that creates a snag in the reader’s mind.  By split testing, you will get to uncover the ads and designs that best work with your demographic. This is why the road to successful Facebook campaigning is a complex one. </span></p>
<p><b>Catchy Images</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: humans are visual creatures.  As a person scrolls down their newsfeed, your ad is competing with hundreds of different posts, images, graphics, and videos.  It can be so jam-packed with content that their eyes never even find your ad. Or they see it, but they see something else that grabs their attention even more, so they click on the other thing and forget about your content completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to ensure you have a catchy image that grab’s the user’s attention is the process of creating buyer personas.  If you have a persona mapped out, you will see that there are so many different types of people, who are interested in different things, but might have in common one thing: your product or service.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there only one type of person who likes Anime?  No. You have people of all ages, genders, and nationalities who enjoy it.  But, by studying different demographics, you can put together a broad idea of what age group likes what.  So, if you’re selling anime shirts for girls, what is that buyer persona? What age group is into anime the most?  What are the things they’re most likely into? A picture will begin to form and you’ll see the types of images that attract them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you might try some different contrasts.  While you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to create an image that grabs your customer’s attention, why not look at creating something that’s different and opposite?  Our brains do well at noticing something that’s out of place, which might work with your ad. </span></p>
<p><b>Fault Finding and Scaling</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will come a time when you have to scale your Facebook ads.  And it can be a challenging process. The way a lot of marketers handle scaling is to just throw more money at their ads, hoping to increase their broader reach.  But throwing more money into your ads rarely works, because ads with a lack of targeting are doomed to fail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need is to breathe more life into your tired campaign.  This is necessary for your success, because no matter how awesome your ads are, if you don’t put them in front of the right eyes, they don’t do that well.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, you’ll end up wasting more money.  Instead, you’ll have to bite the bullet and do a bit of fault finding and scaling of your ads to reach a new audience.  Here are several proven scaling methods to help you continue to target your audience, even the one you don’t have yet, but desperately need to reach out to. </span></p>
<p><b>Discover New Potential Customer Personas</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One factor we already touched on was creating a buyer persona for your perfect type of audience.  If you know who you have to market for, doing demographic research can be a breeze. But as a lot of marketers have their set buyer persona, they might only focus on those which have been successful in the past, ultimately limiting your growth.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give an example, let’s say you sell protein supplements.  You’ve had decent success with your typical buyer persona: bodybuilders.  You might also target those who are interested in getting in shape. But to scale up and reach other personas, you might look at anyone who could benefit from having more protein in their diet, including:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Anyone on a high-protein diet, like Atkins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Anyone who has joined a gym or has expressed interest in doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Women who recently had a baby and is looking to tone back up. </span></p>
<p><b>Segmenting</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One great way to scale your ads is to segment them.  Essentially, segmenting is a form of hyper-targeting.  When you target an ad, you’re going after the one group of people you feel will respond the greatest.  By segmenting, you’ll take a variety of different factors and personas and create ads specifically based on each one.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the high-protein supplements.  You might brand them to men and women differently, since men and women workout differently, build muscle differently, and have different problem areas. Men build muscle quicker and have a single need where you might have to reach out to women by different methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t end there.  Even within the women group, you might consider segmenting further.  One ad is for teen girls. Another ad is to reach potential moms. Another might be to those who already have kids.  And another could be post-menopausal women. You would stick them into their own buyer persona and create different ads for each. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook demographics, as wide and vast as they are, there are so many factors to consider.  Married versus single. Older versus younger. Parent or not? Sedentary lifestyle or active? Segmenting gives you more options to be creative and hyper-target the perfect audience for you.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just a few things to consider. If you’re not scaling and optimizing your ads, you’re just throwing time and money down the drain. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of marketing truths that seem to fight against human nature. When a lot of new marketers and business owners try to advertise, get the word out, and build authority in their niche, they think about the big picture all at once. When they create ads, they make the mistake of trying to blast their message to everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, 90% of new online businesses go under. One of the biggest reasons why include trying to do too much and being everything to everyone. You’re going to waste money throwing a handful of spaghetti at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. The only way to set yourself apart is by narrowing down your niche and your speciality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don’t Be a Jack-of-all-Trades</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the fastest ways to become an industry leader is by choosing a niche and sticking with it.  You might think it’s an obvious statement, but you’d be surprised by how many people are either stuck and don’t know where to begin or work in general terms, not really choosing one niche, but many.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t be an authority figure in a single market if you consider yourself a jack-of-all-trades.  Dabbling in multiple markets makes sure you stay mediocre because your attention is diverted to different projects at once.  Instead, focus on one project and stick with it.  Not only does it make things simpler for you, you can get a faster start building from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><b>Education-Based Marketing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we attempt to be the best, we often see everyone else as competition, as if there’s only room for one at the top. This is a very cold way of getting things done, as you’re missing out on greater opportunities to reach out and build a community.  Our world is changing.  As we become more globalist in the way we live and do business, it’s no longer feasible to cut anyone out.  Your greatest consumers may very well be your competition.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet has also changed the way we do sales.  Consumers expect immediate access in this digital-driven age.  If you have no way of building trust, you’re not going to get far.  Education-based marketing builds trust quicker than someone who uses traditional marketing.  Rather than using the same tired sales pitches, use blogs, books, and other types of content to educate and give the type of information to help buyers make the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then use this educational-based content and get it published in various outlets.  If you can tell your customers that you’re a published author in the field of marketing, or that you’ve had an article you wrote featured in a top magazine, you have instant authority.  They will feel like they can trust you and are more eager to open their wallet over someone with no content to share at all. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Doing One Thing Really Well</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about restaurants for a moment. The local pizza shop also sells burgers on the cheap. If you really want a great burger, do you go to those guys, or the actual burger shop down the road that’s a bit more expensive? You know exactly who to go to if you want a great burger. The pizza shop who tries to do everything most likely doesn’t even have the best pizza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because they’re focused on trying to do too much. They don’t put out the best product and shouldn’t be considered a leader in the industry. They might make a few bucks on their cheap burgers, but they won’t be the company you think about when you’re really craving a juicy cheeseburger. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business works the same way. By creating educational-based marketing and focusing on that one area of expertise, you can be the ‘go-to’ business your customers flock to. They’re eager to learn and improve their lives, so no matter what you do, they’ll come running back, willing to open their wallets again and again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out a specific niche and start from there.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is essential. If people don’t know you exist, how can find you?  And if they can’t find you, you’re simply not making the sales you need to be successful.  While some marketing will offer results, the right kind of marketing can be the difference between mediocre sales and taking off like a rocket. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, good marketing is like a candle in a dark cave.  It will illuminate not just your product, but your entire empire.  Your eyes and your attention will be drawn towards the light!  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right type of marketing,  doesn’t take much to convince your audience that they NEED your product or service, nor can they live without it.  It resonates with them deep down inside.  It identifies their needs.  It educates them and promises to make them better at life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Marketing Basics</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the big secret for marketing the right way?  It’s all about targeting the right crowd.  Your marketing should attract your target audience, not every single person you can get the message to.  Think about it like this: a bug zapper was designed to attract bugs.  That’s what it was built to do.  It’s not meant to attract kangaroos or crocodiles.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources are finite and attempting to attract people who do not fit the target audience is just like setting your money on fire.  Why?  It goes back to knowing the basics.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People buy things for two reasons: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) For gain. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They want to raise their personal brand and improve their image.  To impress.  Maybe it’s the girl they have a crush on or to secure a promotion.  Maybe it entertains them in ways other products cannot.  The purchase is made with one thing in mind: If I buy this product, what will it do for me?   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often do and buy things because it improves the way other people see us.  How many times have you purchased an item simply to build a relationship with someone?  Whatever we purchase, it’s done with gain in mind.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Rolex as an example.  Why should you buy a Rolex?  Well, as the top watchmaker in the world, owning a Rolex has a bit of prestige added to it.  It’s expensive and says something about you.  If you own a Rolex, you’re pure class. It  tells the world you’re an important person.  So, what is Rolex’s message?  “A Rolex will never change the world.  We leave that to the people who wear them.”   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their message is, if you want to be a person of influence, a world changer, a SOMEBODY, then buy a Rolex.  This is what you buy to gain something. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) To avoid pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t purchase life, health, and car insurance because we have a ton of money laying around and have to buy SOMETHING.  And there’s nothing fun or sexy about an insurance policy.  What about home protection systems?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live Florida, you MUST have hurricane shutters.  Oh yes, there’s just something about a large, bulky, non-see-thru shutter to make your house look great!  (sarcasm) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about dental care?  Do you spend big money on a root canal because the dentist is a good friend of yours and you want to support his practice?  Probably not.  You get a root canal because you need one. You get the point. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t make the investment now, you will definitely feel the pain later!  We buy things to avoid feeling that pain. Take a look at this ad: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted works very hard.  Ted has everything. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted finally retires, as does his disability policy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted decides to go fishing.  Ted slips on a trout. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted loses everything.  Don’t be like Ted! </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad then shows Ted in a whole-body cast unable to move.  So why do we spent a lot of money on insurance?  It can almost seem like a waste of money until you’re in Ted’s position.  All it takes is one moment like that, while completely unprotected, to become overwhelmed with hospital bills and eventually losing everything you worked for. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take these two points into account, you should ask yourself what your message is.  What problem are you solving?  How can you make people’s lives better?  Why should anyone buy what you’re selling?  When you do this, it makes your marketing much more effective.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>EDUCATE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your target market on their gain or pain points and how they should depend on your product to soothe their needs. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>ENTERTAIN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your message, so you can hold their attention and intrigue them. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, your marketing should </span><b>ENGAGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them by making them think.  Get in their head by asking questions they are forced to answer.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the difference between simple marketing and good marketing.  Simple marketing just lets the world know your service or product exists, but it goes no further than that.  It may bring in a few sales, but what does it actually do to target and engage?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With good marketing, you are letting them know WHY they should buy and what you offer that no one else does.  How do you meet their needs in a way they can’t get from someone else down the street? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can market along these guidelines, your customers will be opening their wallets to you in no time!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know Google is always playing around with their algorithm to keep the search engine giant as user friendly as possible. Back in 2013, they created what are called review extensions on their ads to help consumers not just see an ad, but actual reviews from other customers as well. If you’ve fall in love with this feature, I’m sorry to break your heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google plans to remove review extensions from their lineup sometime in February 2018. The reviews were quotes from the consumer that could be manually entered for new potential customers to see. The idea was a good one, except for the fact it was difficult to get the review approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you make a process difficult and ads often got rejected due to the extension, it’s going to make that feature unable to be adopted by the mass market. It’s just another good idea on paper that wasn’t executed properly. Since it wasn’t widely adopted, it means this change shouldn’t affect most advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you heavily relied on using this feature, be sure to take the time to download your historical data and save it for later. It’s quite possible that Google institutes a new review extension to ads soon, but one that is easier to use without the complications that killed this version. Whatever it takes to make their users happy, Google is willing to try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think about the change? Did your ads heavily rely on this extension? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are incredibly complex creatures who rely mostly on non-verbal communication. Words can communicate only so much, which is why they say a picture is worth a thousand of them. Nothing can impact your mood more than what you are able to see, which is why advertisers know the true power of compelling images and how they impact buying power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google knows this as well, which is why they’re currently beta testing a new ad feature called Visual Sitelinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Sergey Alakov Tweeted an image of a screenshot he took while browsing on Google. The text ad, urging users to check out their site for a fast, no credit needed approval for a car loan, was accompanied by a picture of a nice truck to the right of the ad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the image work? I can personally attest that the second I saw the truck next to the ad and associated with it. I wanted that truck! That’s how powerful a simple image can be, which is why Google is currently working to bring this to us full time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reply to Search Engine Land, a Google spokesperson said, “We’re always testing new ways to improve our experience for our advertisers and users, but don’t have anything specific to announce right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads have a 40% better response rate if they have an image associate with them, so the fact that Google is still testing ways to better utilize images in their search engine reveals a lot about their priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will this help improve your reach? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see this not only requested by certain clients, but also asked by many marketers this question. The quick answer is &#8211; NO! Marketing for search advertising on Adwords will rarely if at all for another business to find yours. There are other means to advertise to assist in better situations for the B2B market.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong there are certain situations that it may be beneficial to advertise through search. Search Engine Land did a great recent example as to why this may be effective, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/5-successful-b2b-adwords-best-practices-for-any-company-277308"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B2B Practices</span></em></a>. While this may have some good points, for most cases this still wouldn&#8217;t be the BEST option with your client&#8217;s money to advertise to another business.</p>
<p>One good example of an exception is funding and monies, like merchant cash advance. A lot of small businesses will search for funds needed for their business. In my experience with MCA this works quite well if you cross vertical it by people looking for business credit cards and explaining the benefits that MCA can be a more affordable route with a loan and lower interest.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the solution I propose?</strong></p>
<p>Well simple start with looking into ways to advertise specifically to your audience. And most ways of doing so can be through either Google Display, Facebook Ads, even Native advertising. I cannot tell you how helpful it is to specifically target the users you are looking for (small business owners, CEO&#8217;s, manufacturers, etc.) and removing that initial wasteful spend without learning what is and isn&#8217;t working for your campaign. Many of our succesful B2B campaigns work primarily in these areas and have had a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference in B2B and B2C with Adwords and other marketing platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Well aside from the obvious answer the initial biggest difference is understanding the KPI and ROAS goals. With B2B you can afford to receive a much higher cost on both than being a B2C market. And with that being a significant difference it allows to you identify and explore more. In addition majority of the budget that you are given will be a lot more with a B2B market &#8211; If it isn&#8217;t then RUN away and give the proper expectation to your potential client.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are having success with Adwords in your B2B market and plays an easier role than I am describing! I would love to know which!?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most discussed about topics and questions I am asked quite frequently is about landing pages and how it effects their paid search performance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Outdated Landing Page.</strong> The most issue I normally see with poor performance pages is the coding and outdated the page can be. I normally try to push for our clients and internally to go with word press sites. You would be surprised I still see websites that are in flash. (Which is horrible in all cases.)</p>
<p>&#8211; Be sure to have an update landing page preferred WordPress.<br />
&#8211; Optimize web page speed.<br />
&#8211; A/B test all landers with variable using sites like Unbounce, Optimizely, Click funnels.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tracking Codes.</strong> Some clients majority of the time do not have any tracking at all &#8211; and even if they did have the tracking codes the issue was that the code(s) were not properly placed where they needed to be. As we all know if you wish to use re-marketing you want all the pages to have the code on it. And any tracking for conversions need to be placed either through actionable items synced with Analytics or a specific page. In certain cases we have conversions for talk time durations which can only be set up in the Ad Words account itself.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking for conversions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking on any platform including Adwords is enabled for duration of talk times etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Form Fills.</strong> Even with form fills enabled for our client it tends to look more of a contact page, this is not the right approach. We like to differentiate it by having a form box with the required questions for a potential lead. Even at times we may even do a step-by-step questionnaire to keep the user active in answering. Examples would be drop downs, drag bars for approximate debt, and more.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too busy.</strong> This can be a huge difference in advertising your home page or lander. And by the term, &#8220;too busy&#8221; is just sometimes too much information can deter the user from getting them to do the required field of actually filling out a form or call. Don&#8217;t let this happen to your advertising. Make an objective for the user to do and provide an easy way to take action. Every time we either have the form readily visible for the user to fill even with a click to call option on both the bottom of form and top right of the header. Even some images of a phone next to the number provides a quicker response and understanding like an emoji.</p>
<p>These are my top issues I notice, what do you notice with landing pages with your clients? Let&#8217;s discuss!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys it&#8217;s the middle of the week and I wanted to discuss some important paid search opportunities that you can find yourself in! We have recently been working with majority of tow truck owners and have seen a significant success &#8211; so much that we here at Pub Club Leads are willing to take on your account and show you how to get tows using Adwords for <strong>FREE!</strong></p>
<p>So if you know any tow truck companies or own one yourself, sign up! What have you got to lose? We&#8217;ll pay the first $100 of advertisement to prove to you this works! No AAA or insurance calls, all people looking for roadside assistance etc.</p>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>So let&#8217;s discuss the opportunities for anyone taking on clients of this vertical. The right way to structure the campaign and make it a success is going to be the click to call only for the campaign. This will work mainly because the user will be mobile and also in a stressful situation looking to call immediately to have relief. In addition this works well as some users prefer to &#8220;shop&#8221; around, but in this situation they tend to go with the first call quoted just to fix the problem.</p>
<p>You want to run in addition negative keywords associate to your campaign and structure accordingly such as &#8220;aaa&#8221;, &#8220;geico&#8221;, &#8220;all state&#8221;, and so forth. In addition you want your ad to have some call to action with perhaps inclusion of &#8220;24/7&#8221; or even some pricing included for better CTR&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Depending on your campaign you also need to select radius areas that each company services too. Perhaps some do more of the long distance towing which can be a vertical in its self! So hope this quick information helps and receiving calls at a cost of around no more than $6 each! We are currently doing quite the bit of volume in areas in the northern region due to the snow and accidents to be caused higher. Best of luck guys!</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. Tell me which verticals or campaigns you perhaps are keeping you stumped? Love to bring up an article about something the users would prefer! Thanks!</strong></em></p>
