				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that magical time of year again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, the one where people around the world are eager to buy, buy, buy. To a seller, that makes the holiday season truly magical. But to capitalize on the heightened frenzy of holiday shopping, the seller must be at the top of their game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In past years, it was easier to make a few bucks with paid ads as online sales shared a smaller portion of overall profits. Brick and mortar still dominated the landscape and it was impossible to compete with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then something started to happen. It shocked the marketing world, including me! I never thought I’d see the day when Walmart was fighting and clawing its way back to relevancy, but Amazon has sure put retail in its place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will only tell if empty Walmart stores will dot the landscape, just as you occasionally see with Kmart and Circuit City. Innovation and simplicity is here to rule the day, and no one will be able to stop the momentum.</span></p>
<p><b>The Digital Shift is Happening</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to TechCrunch, online sales are up almost 20% from last year, hitting a new record of $2.87 billion. The numbers Amazon raked in were so astonishing, I had to double check several sources to make sure it was right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About HALF of all online sales went to Amazon, reportedly inhaling $1 billion in a 24-hour span.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have so many billions flowing through internet, sellers are finding no shortage of competition flooding in, hoping to take advantage. According to a Twitter #PPCCHAT poll, 61% of marketers felt the pressure from increased competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at the Google insights, you can clearly see that all the numbers are up for the year, including mobile traffic. Yes, more people are buying Christmas gifts on their mobile device!</span></p>
<p><b>How Can You Compete?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With competitors flooding the market, you might be asking yourself how to keep your sales flowing. It might require you to change your tactics, including personalizing your ad campaigns for Christmas sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many marketers get caught up in the daily flow of their business and completely forget about preparing ahead of time for the holidays. This is especially true for new marketers who are fully engaged in getting everything up and running smoothly. It also means if you prepare early for the holiday season, you’re ahead of the influx of new competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas season is chocked full of emotional buyers who buy gifts just to see the smile on their loved one’s face. Take advantage of it. Google trends reveal that people start thinking about buying as far back as August! Just the anticipation for the upcoming season is enough.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see this not only requested by certain clients, but also asked by many marketers this question. The quick answer is &#8211; NO! Marketing for search advertising on Adwords will rarely if at all for another business to find yours. There are other means to advertise to assist in better situations for the B2B market.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong there are certain situations that it may be beneficial to advertise through search. Search Engine Land did a great recent example as to why this may be effective, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/5-successful-b2b-adwords-best-practices-for-any-company-277308"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B2B Practices</span></em></a>. While this may have some good points, for most cases this still wouldn&#8217;t be the BEST option with your client&#8217;s money to advertise to another business.</p>
<p>One good example of an exception is funding and monies, like merchant cash advance. A lot of small businesses will search for funds needed for their business. In my experience with MCA this works quite well if you cross vertical it by people looking for business credit cards and explaining the benefits that MCA can be a more affordable route with a loan and lower interest.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the solution I propose?</strong></p>
<p>Well simple start with looking into ways to advertise specifically to your audience. And most ways of doing so can be through either Google Display, Facebook Ads, even Native advertising. I cannot tell you how helpful it is to specifically target the users you are looking for (small business owners, CEO&#8217;s, manufacturers, etc.) and removing that initial wasteful spend without learning what is and isn&#8217;t working for your campaign. Many of our succesful B2B campaigns work primarily in these areas and have had a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference in B2B and B2C with Adwords and other marketing platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Well aside from the obvious answer the initial biggest difference is understanding the KPI and ROAS goals. With B2B you can afford to receive a much higher cost on both than being a B2C market. And with that being a significant difference it allows to you identify and explore more. In addition majority of the budget that you are given will be a lot more with a B2B market &#8211; If it isn&#8217;t then RUN away and give the proper expectation to your potential client.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are having success with Adwords in your B2B market and plays an easier role than I am describing! I would love to know which!?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>tend to get this question a lot with my clients, “Alex, how can I take my content and be able to get the traffic quickly?”</p>
<p>Well, the these are some steps I take in sharing my content and being able to increase Alexa rank and overal SERP’s (search engine result position).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Share your new post on all social media platforms.</strong>Begin sharing on all your accounts, but not just the main post. You want to also post in the groups as well. Did you even know <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linked In</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and Twitter &#8211; have those? If not, I suggest you either create one in your market or look for some that are relative to not only your post…. But your audiences as well.
<p>Don’t even forget to hashtag the discussion that may be popular for others to discover as well. I see this strategy overlooked a lot. Although it may not see immediate results from this, it’s best to conquer all areas then to question “have I done it?”</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Post on forums and discussions.</strong>The main one I find to help a lot is Reddit. This site can do wonders for traffic! I mean gaining quick traffic with people constantly browsing for things is great. You wouldn’t imagine the different topics you can find that will fit your post. So be sure to look into this one as a priority.</li>
<li><strong>Place photo’s on Pinterest, Tumblr, and other picture oriented sites from your content.</strong>If you have an image that your posting about, or just perhaps something to place in the content to make it more visual for the readers… share it! There are ton of websites to work with on your image. Be sure to link it. (Sure it may not be a back link, but it’s still an outside traffic referral source.)</li>
<li><strong>Social bookmark your content.</strong>Sure <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> isn’t the same as it used to be, but it is still a source. I find to use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stumbleupon/">Stumble Upon Toolbar</a> a lot more cause  I actually see the page index from it, and it&#8217;s convient. But be sure to use this tactic as another source for people to share as well.</li>
<li><strong>Link Exchange.</strong>Always look for potential link exchanges with other sites/authors to share the content with outside readers that you normally wouldn&#8217;t reach.</li>
<li> <strong>Add paid sources to your content for visible traffic.</strong>When gathering data and more we like to utilize Outbrain and Taboola as sources for additional traffic to gain some information as to whether the content was captive, informational, or even viral. If you have Adsense this would be a great affordable traffic that can reduce the overhead cost with the traffic coming in.
<p>For more information I would be sure to refer to this <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/29/sharing-great-posts/">site</a>. I believe his outline covers mine but gives some additional tips. Best of luck and keep writing!</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know the major player in all directories will be Google Places/Business. But what about the other areas that can find some organic free traffic of possible other people finding you? Here&#8217;s my list of the top 20 you should be on, enjoy!</p>
<p>Twenty other relevant directories that could increase exposure for your business include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bing Places for Business:</strong> Only Google outpaces this free Microsoft product in visits, and you can add multiple business locations, photos, videos, and more during your fast, free, and easy registration. Because Bing is the default search engine for desktop and tablet versions of Windows 8, some tablet, desktop, and laptop owners opt for Bing over Google. Enroll <strong><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35734" src="https://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing.png" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" srcset="http://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing-300x163.png 300w, http://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing.png 358w" alt="20places-bing" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yahoo Local Listing:</strong> Ranking third next to Google and Bing, Yahoo’s service draws millions of searches daily. A basic listing is free, but $9.95/month allows you to add photos and a company description, and $29.99/month buys you listings in more than 40 other online directories. “Although Yahoo is no longer the search engine giant it once was, Yahoo Local is a great supplement to your online local strategy,” advises Amanda DiSilvestro on <strong><a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2271750/yahoo-local-how-to-set-up-optimize-your-business-listing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearchEngineWatch.com</a>.</strong> Create your listing <strong><a href="https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/local-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yelp</strong> is one of the best online sources for candid consumer reviews. Bonus: It allows you to send public or private messages (including deals) to customers and review business trends using the Yelp reporting tool. In terms of <a href="https://www.yelp.com/factsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographics</a>, 42 percent of Yelp users are 18 to 34, 61 percent are college grads and 46 percent earn $100,000 or more annually. The most reviewed categories on Yelp include shopping, restaurants, and home services respectively. Enroll <strong><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</strong></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most discussed about topics and questions I am asked quite frequently is about landing pages and how it effects their paid search performance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Outdated Landing Page.</strong> The most issue I normally see with poor performance pages is the coding and outdated the page can be. I normally try to push for our clients and internally to go with word press sites. You would be surprised I still see websites that are in flash. (Which is horrible in all cases.)</p>
<p>&#8211; Be sure to have an update landing page preferred WordPress.<br />
&#8211; Optimize web page speed.<br />
&#8211; A/B test all landers with variable using sites like Unbounce, Optimizely, Click funnels.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tracking Codes.</strong> Some clients majority of the time do not have any tracking at all &#8211; and even if they did have the tracking codes the issue was that the code(s) were not properly placed where they needed to be. As we all know if you wish to use re-marketing you want all the pages to have the code on it. And any tracking for conversions need to be placed either through actionable items synced with Analytics or a specific page. In certain cases we have conversions for talk time durations which can only be set up in the Ad Words account itself.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking for conversions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Proper tracking on any platform including Adwords is enabled for duration of talk times etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Form Fills.</strong> Even with form fills enabled for our client it tends to look more of a contact page, this is not the right approach. We like to differentiate it by having a form box with the required questions for a potential lead. Even at times we may even do a step-by-step questionnaire to keep the user active in answering. Examples would be drop downs, drag bars for approximate debt, and more.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too busy.</strong> This can be a huge difference in advertising your home page or lander. And by the term, &#8220;too busy&#8221; is just sometimes too much information can deter the user from getting them to do the required field of actually filling out a form or call. Don&#8217;t let this happen to your advertising. Make an objective for the user to do and provide an easy way to take action. Every time we either have the form readily visible for the user to fill even with a click to call option on both the bottom of form and top right of the header. Even some images of a phone next to the number provides a quicker response and understanding like an emoji.</p>
<p>These are my top issues I notice, what do you notice with landing pages with your clients? Let&#8217;s discuss!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone it&#8217;s Alex with Pub Club Leads! I wanted to discuss some of the most common mistakes I see when diving into AdWords accounts. Hopefully this article will allow you to ensure not to make the same mistake, or consider this a checklist for your account structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Paying for negative keywords or not adding negative keywords in the search terms.</strong> This is by the far the biggest issue I notice in a lot of accounts. It&#8217;s a shame but not many people are aware about it or feel if they have the right match type it will eliminate any wasteful spend &#8211; not true!<br />
Be sure on a daily or every other day to look to see what the search terms are and add accordingly for any negative keywords you DON&#8217;T want to show up for.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Not using extensions.</strong> Majority of these extensions not only improve your CTR and quality score, but it&#8217;s &#8220;FREE REAL ESTATE&#8221;. Use as many extensions as you can for your business &#8211; majority of the time it will make sense!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-250 aligncenter" src="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate-300x225.jpg" alt="Free Real Estate" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate-300x225.jpg 300w, http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/free_real_estate.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Not tracking conversions.</strong> I am sure a lot of us paid specialists can agree that not tracking your conversions is basically throwing money out the window! This is seen a mass majority of the time and it&#8217;s a shame I still see it to this day! But I implore anyone to go to the tools tab and click on conversions to begin tracking, even if you cannot &#8211; surely your web developer can!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-251 aligncenter" src="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/money_out_window-300x267.jpg" alt="Money Out Window" width="300" height="267" srcset="http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/money_out_window-300x267.jpg 300w, http://pubclubleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/money_out_window.jpg 403w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. Not Using Bid Adjustments: </b>This is huge! For many campaigns some get a lower CPA on mobile then they do on desktop devices. If this were true, change your bid adjustment by certain percentage that makes sense. If you really want to go all out, then create a mobile campaign only. But not using this bid option is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Too many keywords in one adgroup.</strong> This is the funniest part of the whole article honestly, because I literally tally the most keywords I have ever seen in an adgroup and so far that number is literally over 150! Please use best practice and try to keep it anywhere to maximum of 10-15! If you want to go the hardest route, some believe to go one keyword variant per adgroup &#8211; this could work out well especially if trying to optimize per keyword on call duration conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Google Adwords Express.</strong> I really cannot elaborate too much on this as this could be the #1 sin in paid search ever! Please do not use this feature ever, even if Google themselves recommend it! You need control and the best way to do that is using Google&#8217;s Adword platform as a whole. Be sure any campaign you create especially search to use all features. You want to be able to use manual bidding &#8211; it&#8217;ll be important long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary hopefully you are not a victim on any of these top mistakes that I notice majority of the time. If you feel you ever need assistance on your paid search or just have a general question feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:alex.heme@pubclubleads.com">alex.heme@pubclubleads.com</a>. Have a great week everyone!</p>
