				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start this off with a bold statement: if you want to run a successful business, then you need to have an email marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to evolve and new marketing strategies are developed, one strategy has stood the test of time.  In fact, for the last decade, email marketing has ruled the online landscape.</span></p>
<p><b>Email is Better than Social Networking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s market, a lot of business owners focus on social networking.  It’s a great way to drive traffic, but it’s not the best way to make a buck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more active email accounts out there today than there are users on both Facebook and Twitter combined. When a potential customer opts-in, they’re giving you an opportunity to pitch to them directly. It’s personal and intimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook ads can be wasted money.  Statistically speaking, only 2% of your list will see your ad. It’s easy to scroll by and miss the information you want them to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send an email, it forces the customer to act.  They can’t just scroll by the email. They’re forced to look at it and decide whether it’s worth opening.</span></p>
<p><b>Crunching the Numbers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ROI for email marketing is $38 for every $1 spent.  That’s a return of 3,800%! You’re not going to find those kinds of numbers anywhere! The problem is, most business owners don’t know how to properly use email marketing to get that that type of return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It often takes a year or more of tinkering around, playing with keywords, studying headlines, building relationships, and delivering adequate content to increase your return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has the time or the money to strategize and wait for the results to start rolling in?  Is your email campaign actually costing you money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to tell your story and sell your brand in a way that gets customers to click and buy.</span></p>
<p><b>Having Your Own Cheat Sheet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to use email marketing the right way is like getting in shape.  You know what your goals are, but you don’t know how to get there. There’s nothing wrong with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s not designed for you and your goals, it’s a waste of time.  That’s why we exist. We’re successful at helping business owners take the next step and are here to give you that helping hand as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the benefits of being able to automate your campaign.  That means the money is still coming in, even while you’re sleeping!  If you want to go on vacation, that’s perfectly fine. Your campaign is still making money while you’re sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel that your email campaign is lackluster or that you’ve tried everything to improve your ROI, but nothing seems to work, Pub Club Leads can help get your campaign on track. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see this not only requested by certain clients, but also asked by many marketers this question. The quick answer is &#8211; NO! Marketing for search advertising on Adwords will rarely if at all for another business to find yours. There are other means to advertise to assist in better situations for the B2B market.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong there are certain situations that it may be beneficial to advertise through search. Search Engine Land did a great recent example as to why this may be effective, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/5-successful-b2b-adwords-best-practices-for-any-company-277308"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B2B Practices</span></em></a>. While this may have some good points, for most cases this still wouldn&#8217;t be the BEST option with your client&#8217;s money to advertise to another business.</p>
<p>One good example of an exception is funding and monies, like merchant cash advance. A lot of small businesses will search for funds needed for their business. In my experience with MCA this works quite well if you cross vertical it by people looking for business credit cards and explaining the benefits that MCA can be a more affordable route with a loan and lower interest.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the solution I propose?</strong></p>
<p>Well simple start with looking into ways to advertise specifically to your audience. And most ways of doing so can be through either Google Display, Facebook Ads, even Native advertising. I cannot tell you how helpful it is to specifically target the users you are looking for (small business owners, CEO&#8217;s, manufacturers, etc.) and removing that initial wasteful spend without learning what is and isn&#8217;t working for your campaign. Many of our succesful B2B campaigns work primarily in these areas and have had a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference in B2B and B2C with Adwords and other marketing platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Well aside from the obvious answer the initial biggest difference is understanding the KPI and ROAS goals. With B2B you can afford to receive a much higher cost on both than being a B2C market. And with that being a significant difference it allows to you identify and explore more. In addition majority of the budget that you are given will be a lot more with a B2B market &#8211; If it isn&#8217;t then RUN away and give the proper expectation to your potential client.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are having success with Adwords in your B2B market and plays an easier role than I am describing! I would love to know which!?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know the major player in all directories will be Google Places/Business. But what about the other areas that can find some organic free traffic of possible other people finding you? Here&#8217;s my list of the top 20 you should be on, enjoy!</p>
<p>Twenty other relevant directories that could increase exposure for your business include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bing Places for Business:</strong> Only Google outpaces this free Microsoft product in visits, and you can add multiple business locations, photos, videos, and more during your fast, free, and easy registration. Because Bing is the default search engine for desktop and tablet versions of Windows 8, some tablet, desktop, and laptop owners opt for Bing over Google. Enroll <strong><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35734" src="https://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing.png" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" srcset="http://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing-300x163.png 300w, http://blog.verticalresponse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20places-bing.png 358w" alt="20places-bing" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yahoo Local Listing:</strong> Ranking third next to Google and Bing, Yahoo’s service draws millions of searches daily. A basic listing is free, but $9.95/month allows you to add photos and a company description, and $29.99/month buys you listings in more than 40 other online directories. “Although Yahoo is no longer the search engine giant it once was, Yahoo Local is a great supplement to your online local strategy,” advises Amanda DiSilvestro on <strong><a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2271750/yahoo-local-how-to-set-up-optimize-your-business-listing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearchEngineWatch.com</a>.</strong> Create your listing <strong><a href="https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/local-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yelp</strong> is one of the best online sources for candid consumer reviews. Bonus: It allows you to send public or private messages (including deals) to customers and review business trends using the Yelp reporting tool. In terms of <a href="https://www.yelp.com/factsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographics</a>, 42 percent of Yelp users are 18 to 34, 61 percent are college grads and 46 percent earn $100,000 or more annually. The most reviewed categories on Yelp include shopping, restaurants, and home services respectively.
