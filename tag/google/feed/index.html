				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for a reason to upgrade your website, this is it! Google announced earlier this week their intention to implement a new mobile search algorithm designed to give preference to faster sites.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google calls it the “Speed Update” and not everyone will feel the impact. If your site measures up in the speed department, you’ll likely see no change in how you’re ranked. According to the search engine giant, only a “small percentage” of sites, the ones who consistently rank low when it comes to loading times.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is yet another step by Google to improve user performance. It was only back in 2010 when they stated their full intention and focus was on desktop user speed, but it was only a few short years later in 2014 when the number of mobile users surpassed those who used the site on their desktop.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this shift in user preference, many industries have had to change the way they create and display ads. They suddenly had to be both desktop and mobile friendly, a lesson Facebook instantly learned when the mobile revolution took off. They weren’t prepared and had one of the worst online mobile apps on the internet.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing how quickly things were changing, Facebook, went into action and continues to find new ways to give mobile users the best experience possible. Now Google is jumping in and rewarding the sites with faster speeds.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is clear: if you’re not actively working to improve mobile reach, your competitors will get the traffic. It’s okay though. You have plenty of time to prepare your website for the change. The new algorithm isn’t set to be in place until July 2018.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know Google is always playing around with their algorithm to keep the search engine giant as user friendly as possible. Back in 2013, they created what are called review extensions on their ads to help consumers not just see an ad, but actual reviews from other customers as well. If you’ve fall in love with this feature, I’m sorry to break your heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google plans to remove review extensions from their lineup sometime in February 2018. The reviews were quotes from the consumer that could be manually entered for new potential customers to see. The idea was a good one, except for the fact it was difficult to get the review approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you make a process difficult and ads often got rejected due to the extension, it’s going to make that feature unable to be adopted by the mass market. It’s just another good idea on paper that wasn’t executed properly. Since it wasn’t widely adopted, it means this change shouldn’t affect most advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you heavily relied on using this feature, be sure to take the time to download your historical data and save it for later. It’s quite possible that Google institutes a new review extension to ads soon, but one that is easier to use without the complications that killed this version. Whatever it takes to make their users happy, Google is willing to try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think about the change? Did your ads heavily rely on this extension? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are incredibly complex creatures who rely mostly on non-verbal communication. Words can communicate only so much, which is why they say a picture is worth a thousand of them. Nothing can impact your mood more than what you are able to see, which is why advertisers know the true power of compelling images and how they impact buying power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google knows this as well, which is why they’re currently beta testing a new ad feature called Visual Sitelinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Sergey Alakov Tweeted an image of a screenshot he took while browsing on Google. The text ad, urging users to check out their site for a fast, no credit needed approval for a car loan, was accompanied by a picture of a nice truck to the right of the ad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the image work? I can personally attest that the second I saw the truck next to the ad and associated with it. I wanted that truck! That’s how powerful a simple image can be, which is why Google is currently working to bring this to us full time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reply to Search Engine Land, a Google spokesperson said, “We’re always testing new ways to improve our experience for our advertisers and users, but don’t have anything specific to announce right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads have a 40% better response rate if they have an image associate with them, so the fact that Google is still testing ways to better utilize images in their search engine reveals a lot about their priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will this help improve your reach? </span></p>

		<title>Google is Still Updating Penguin and Panda Updates for SEO</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, algorithms. Love them or hate them, where would your business be today without algorithms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the online world, algorithms make or break everything. And no, I’m not exaggerating. Try marketing on Facebook when they decide to change the way people see what you post. You can go from having amazing sales to barely getting a drop in the bucket, all because they decided to change their algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is the same way. Over the years, they’ve had different programs in place that marketers have learned to adapt into their marketing platform. In the beginning, Google was easy to use. They rarely updated any of their programming. If they made an update, you would have to change anything for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a technological age advanced and more people started filing their way in, Google needed to find a way to compete. The only way to do that is to constantly update your algorithms. It started with Google Coffee, which later became Panda and Penguin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s not so uncommon if Google updates several times a day rather than every few months. As much as it stings a lot of marketers, Google and Facebook do not care about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They care about the everyday user and ensuring that all search results cater to their needs. This is why you need to be careful if you do business online. It was recently confirmed by a Google employee, who has been with the company for over six years, that they STILL update Panda and Penguin despite moving on to a new algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to be aware of this as any unannounced changes will leave you in your website unprepared and you out of luck. It will disrupt your flow of traffic, drop your rankings on Google, and even mess with the accessibility of your site.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficult part is knowing when they start to tweak. Again, because these changes are purely for the consumer and everyday user, Google doesn’t feel the need to alert marketers of this change. In fact, it had been long believed that Panda and Penguin were obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that it’s been confirmed that they still update it from time to time, that should be a big enough of a warning to anyone in this space.</span></p>
