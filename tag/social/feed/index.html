				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one thing to create an ad and start advertising on Facebook, but it’s something else entirely to track all the numbers you get in return and apply it for the ultimate success of your business.  The numbers might not match the goals you had in mind. Or maybe those goals have changed. What do you do now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, every advertising campaign will need to be tweaked at some point.  Rarely does anyone get it right the very first time, especially when they’re first starting and aren’t too familiar with their audience yet.  You can make some wild (or even educated) guesses, but you won’t truly know how the market will react until you’re out there in the thick of it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight, so even if your ads are running smoothly, there’s room for improvement.  You’re going to have to optimize your campaign and scale your ads. First, let’s take a look at ways you can better define your objectives to create the best plan possible.</span></p>
<p><b>What Are Your Goals?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing your ads doesn’t start after you’ve already created them, but before.  You need a good targeting strategy and goals planned beforehand. How will you know if the ads are performing well if you don’t have your goals mapped out?  This is your only measure of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need to understand what Facebook is. It’s a social networking site.  When people jump on Facebook, they’re doing it interact with friends and hang out.  They hop on to relax and clear the mind after a long day. That’s why it’s difficult to sell products and can involve some complex processes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Facebook being committed to sharing only user-relevant content, you need to find a way to brand yourself in a way that’s relevant to potential customers.  Do you advertise in ways that fit neatly on their Newsfeed? Is your content organic? This will ultimately matter as you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal when it comes to advertising on Facebook is brand awareness.  Facebook isn’t great with direct sales. It will take time, targeting, and energy as you develop relationships with your potential customers.  To get any kind of traction on Facebook, you must be content-driven. Most products or services are ‘discovered’ on Facebook through content.</span></p>
<p><b>Split Testing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you spend time and money working out your ad campaigns, your job isn’t done.  The most recommended method to determining what works and what doesn’t is by split-testing.  Split testing (or A/B testing) is a way to determine what graphics, copy, imagines, headlines, and call-to-actions drive more of your targeted audience to convert.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to know off hand which ads will work.  You can have all the right stuff together, but if the call-to-action needs more work or there’s an off word, that creates a snag in the reader’s mind.  By split testing, you will get to uncover the ads and designs that best work with your demographic. This is why the road to successful Facebook campaigning is a complex one.</span></p>
<p><b>Catchy Images</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are visual creatures.  As a person scrolls down their newsfeed, your ad is competing with hundreds of different posts, images, graphics, and videos.  It can be so jam-packed with content that their eyes never even find your ad. Or they see it, but they see something else that grabs their attention even more, so they click on the other thing and forget about your content completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to ensure you have a catchy image that grab’s the user’s attention is the process of creating buyer personas.  Write down a persona for every type of person who might want to buy from you. If you have a persona mapped out, you will see that there are so many different types of people, who are interested in different things, but might have in common one thing: your product or service.  </span></p>
<p><b>Fault Finding and Scaling</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will come a time when you have to scale your Facebook ads.  And it can be a challenging process. The way a lot of marketers handle scaling is to just throw more money at their ads, hoping to increase their broader reach.  Throwing more money into your ads rarely works because of the lack of proper targeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need is to breathe more life into your tired campaign.  This is necessary for your success, because no matter how awesome your ads are, if you don’t put them in front of the right eyes, they don’t do that well.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social networking can be one of the most powerful tools in your business’s arsenal, but only if you know how to use it correctly.  It has the potential to grow your audience and bring in many new customers in ways no other platform can.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you don’t understand how social networking works, it can be difficult to get started.  New business owners and marketers jump in without knowing the market and how it works. Give yourself an advantage when it comes to learning the right strategies for your campaign to excel.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to give your business a boost, there are several ‘laws’ of social networking you must follow if you truly hope to build your brand, take care of your customers, and make more money.</span></p>
<h3><b>1) Listen to your audience.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems as if everyone today has a voice, which can be used to your benefit if you know how to listen.  In fact, your success depends on it.  Take the time to invest in your audience’s content.  Understand them.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join the many discussions they no doubt have about what they love, what they hate, what can be done better, etc.   If you come across as an arrogant know-it-all, as if you know more than they do, you won’t get too far.  It’s only by listening to their needs and adjusting will you be able to serve them.</span></p>
<h3><b>2) Targeting is key.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why social media works so well in business and advertising is because you get to fine-tune your ads, content, and strategy to exactly the specifications that will sell your product or service.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remain specialized and focused, rather than doing a bunch of different things at once, you have a greater opportunity for success.  Be fine-tuned and laser-focused.  These are strategies you can teach yourself, so your marketing campaigns reach the right audience.</span></p>
<h3><b>3) Quality vs. quantity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s possible to get hundreds of thousands of ‘fans’ or ‘followers’ on your social network.  That may be exciting to you, having so many people follow you, but I can guarantee you many (if not most) of them are not quality prospects. They’re not true leads. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 connections who actually engage, interact, share your content, and get enjoyment from what you do is MUCH more valuable than thousands who just fill up your page.  That’s why you target to small sample size of potential customers verses blasting your ads all over the web. </span></p>
<h3><b>4) Be patient!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing isn’t an overnight, get rich quick venture.  It’s about building and maintaining relationships.  It’s possible, but extremely unlikely, to go viral, so be sure to plan and stick it out for the long run if you truly hope to get the results you desire.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With understanding that results often don’t come quick, that also means not treating your followers as if they are no more than a dollar sign.  Actually get down and dirty growing a friendship/partnership with them.   </span></p>
<h3><b>5) Create great content.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going along with number four, if you take the time to build a relationship with your audience, and you consistently produce amazing content, that audience will become your best source of advertising.  They’ll share that content with their friends on every other social networking platform.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will eventually help you out in the long run on Google, opening the door for a much larger and higher quality audience.</span></p>
<h3><b>6) Never stop growing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might come a time when you find a bit of success and you get a big head about it.  It’s easy to do, as it’s human nature to get comfortable, but I must implore you to never stop being a student.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones who stop trying to learn and grow are the ones who get left behind.  As quickly as things change, there’s always something else to learn.  </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So take the time to find the other experts and influencers in your niche who not only will teach you, but encourage and even coach you.  No matter how awesome you think you are, there’s always more to learn and ways to expand.   </span></p>
