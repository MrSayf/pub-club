				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the most part, technology hasn’t changed the way humans have lived for most of our history on this planet.  Think about it for a second.  For thousands of years, what mode of transportation have our ancestors shared?  Horses.  Wagons.  It wasn’t until 1885 when Karl Benz invented the first car.  Look at how far we’ve come just in the last 100+ years.</p>
<p>In 1914, if you wanted to travel to Asia from the United States, it would’ve taken you 40 days.  Now, we have supersonic jets that will cross the Pacific in about 14 hours. As of this writing, they are currently researching and building jets that can take you from New York to London in about 20 minutes.  </p>
<p>Travel is just the beginning.  Think about all the advancements in medicine, hygiene, genetics, vaccines, food, surgical care, housing, consumer products, buying and selling, radio, TV, video games, electricity, heat/air conditioning, refrigeration, telephones, space travel, cameras, and computers.  These are all relatively new advancements that have changed the course of human history forever.</p>
<p>These advances haven’t only impacted the way we live and how we entertain ourselves, but it also changed the business world forever.  Thanks to the internet, we’re now a highly-connected species.  Who would’ve ever imagined having the ability to video chat with someone instantly who lived on the other side of the planet?  </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Founder of Facebook, boasts having connected nearly 2 billion people with his platform.  That’s 2 billion people who are spread out across the globe, but thanks to the internet, they might as well be in the next room.  This type of connectivity has allowed for major changes in how we do business.</p>
<p>Consider that for thousands of years, up until about 15-20 years ago, the strongest industries were involved in natural resources, like coal, oil, wood, and mining.  Suddenly, the internet goes commercial, connecting the world, and changing how companies compete globally.  The top companies in the world are now tech giants, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.</p>
<p>CEOs now make billions on ideas, instead of commodities.</p>
<p>As the world continues to get smaller, we are becoming more of a melting pot.  Cultures are mixing, as are languages and lifestyles.  When you have a variety of different people and languages living in one area, it can complicate the infrastructure of government, business, schools, and even the economy</p>
<p>As a budding entrepreneur, the secret to success is tapping into this resource and knowing how to use technology to your advantage. There’s no other medium where you can reach across the globe and advertise your products to millions than social media. You’ll have to learn about demographics, scaling ads, and how to reach an audience.</p>
<p>If you want your website to get traffic, you’ll need to know how to utilize SEO in your content. You’ll need to design a website that’s fast, efficient, and catches the eye.</p>
<p>The toughest part for new online entrepreneurs to understand is how quickly the tech is changing. It seems as if new stuff comes out every other day. If you struggle with keeping up, or you have no idea where to start, you have two options:</p>
<p>1) Take several years and try to figure it out yourself.<br />
2) Find a company who already knows how to do it and hire them.</p>
<p>Agencies like Pub Club Leads are experts helping people get on the right track right out of the gate. The last thing you want to do is start your business already behind. It costs new entrepreneurs several years and many thousands of dollars’ worth of failed attempts before they get a grasp on what they’re doing.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re doing, your best bet is to ask for help. It doesn’t matter if you need a little bit of help, or a lot of it. All it takes is a single wrongly-worded ad to keep your sales down.</p>
<p>The technology revolution isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Right now is the perfect time to pursue that business idea, but don’t do it alone. Let Pub Club Leads guide you through the process and give you the edge you need to outsmart your competitors and make the kind of money you always dreamed you’d make working from home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has ever decided to start their own business knows how difficult it can be to break through the noise and reach the top of their chosen industry.  In some circumstances, it can even seem impossible.  How do you reach your market with a blog when there are over 100 million blogs out there in cyberspace already?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is your website going to set you apart from your competitors when there are hundreds of millions of websites out there right this second?  Often, a lot of entrepreneurs give up their dreams of starting a business because the deck seems so incredibly stacked against them from the start.  It’s not a lack of passion or hard work, but of authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the work you’re putting in right now that will separate you from your competitors?  How are you differentiating yourself in your niche market that’s making the industry sit up and pay attention?  How are you reaching new clients and customers in a way that is unique and engaging?  The people are hungry for content, yet a lot of business owners do the bare minimum, hoping they take off like a rocket.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet continues to expand into many different realms and markets, there will be no shortage of opportunities to come up with the next big idea, but also no shortage of competition.  Intense competition means you can either take a backseat and hope something turns viral or you can take the bull by its horns and step up your game.   </span></p>
<p><b>Being a Leader is Never Easy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming from a position of authority isn’t easy for everyone.  Some people seem to be born leaders while others are content holding back for the sake of self-preservation.  Being a leader means being vulnerable and open to attack.  Let’s use McDonalds as an example.  McDonald’s is at the very top of all the fast food restaurants, both in profits and the number of restaurants available.  They’ve cornered the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did McDonald&#8217;s get to the top?  Was it because they have the best hamburgers?  No.  The best customer service?  Not really.  The answer is, they provided value to their customers.  They were different and vastly stood out.  The same goes for becoming an authority figure.  You don’t have to be the world’s number one expert at what you do.  You just have to be good enough to continue growing and expanding while providing value in an underutilized market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is, it’s human nature to sink below the waterline and not be different from the crowd.  We fear confrontation and everyone else in your market will be trying to take you down.  Is McDonald&#8217;s the unhealthiest of all the fast food chains?  Again, not really.  There are other companies that have vastly greater portions, but because McDonalds is at the top, they get most the bad press.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being the leader is worth it.  Everyone around the world recognizes the Golden Arches.  Despite not being the best at what they do, they still reign as the true king of fast food sales, and it’s not even close.  In 2014, McDonalds brought in $35 billion in sales, while their closest competitor, Subway, only brought in $12 billion.  How did they do it, while overcoming the attacks that routinely come from competitors?  AUTHORITY. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Educate Your Audience with Content</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been paying any attention whatsoever to the leaders of many industries, there is one thing they do that really sets them apart from anyone else.  They don’t remain focused on their business goals exclusively.  They’re still pulling in big bucks, but they take advantage of their platform to step outside of their comfort zone.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve spent many years cultivating knowledge, gaining experience, and slaying obstacles, it’s one thing to use that to build your own business, but something else altogether to help lift other people out of the mud.  You see, a lot of these top people in their field gain almost a celebrity status.  How?  With content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them have a book.  They have blogs.  They’re constantly sharing different strategies they picked up in their own journey that helps someone else lower on the totem pole overcome a challenge in their own business.  And when that happens, what does it do for the guy on top?  What did he just create by helping others?  He gained respect and authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is truly how you become an industry leader. People flock to you and are more willing to open their wallets to you if they know you have something to offer. If you’re the person taking care of their needs, then you’re set for life.</span></p>
