				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by talking about why you need a website in the first place. Your website is your home base. If you were opening a law firm, you wouldn’t meet clients on a street corner or in your backyard. It wouldn’t be professional. The same goes for being an internet authority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a website that tells people you’re a professional. It’s the online equivalent of an office or store.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as a potential customer lands on your website, you want them to be impressed. It should feel comfortable to them even though it’s their first visit. That means it needs to load quickly and be easy for them to navigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that the average amount of time most internet users were willing to wait for a website to load was six seconds. That’s the point when most of them will hit the dreaded back button to return to their search results and try another site.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site also needs to look professional. If you want people to take you seriously, your site can’t be a mish-mash of eye-searing colors and extravagant fonts. No one wants to feel as if their eyes have been assaulted. It’s fine to use bright colors or fancy lettering, but you need to do so in moderation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, of course, your site also needs to contain valuable information. You can have the best-looking site on the internet, but if it doesn’t include information that’s relevant to your area of authority, it won’t do you any good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples:  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should have a well-written “About” page that explains who you are and why visitors to your site can trust you as an authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your blog can add a lot of authority to your site –it’s the perfect way to show people that you know your stuff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Some authority sites have a page where they list industry news –another way to demonstrate that you understand what’s happening in your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-A well-organized and helpful resource page is another way of demonstrating authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you get the idea. Nothing on your site should be there if it doesn’t demonstrate your authority.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why You Should Consider a Professional Designer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re just getting started in your new niche and maybe you’re worried about money. That’s understandable, but I’m about to tell you about the one area where you can’t afford to skimp: the design of your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seriously consider hiring a professional designer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you saying to yourself, “But I know a little HTML. I built a site when I was in high school on FreeWebs. How hard can it be?” If you are saying these things, you need to stop. This isn’t high school and you can’t afford to have a shoddily-designed website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional designer can make sure that your site: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Looks great  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Has good flow and is easy to navigate  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Includes all the features a good website needs, including a search function, professional menus, and working links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not suggesting you need to go overboard and try to make your website the best ever, although if you can afford that, then go for it. You do need to ensure that everything on your website looks professional and works properly.  You can’t do that without a professional designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if writing isn’t your strong suit, you should seriously consider hiring a professional writer to write the content for your site. If you do want to write it yourself, that’s fine – but get a professional to proofread it. You don’t want your website going live only to have people point out spelling and grammatical errors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t do a thing to add to your authority. A professional writer can also help you optimize your pages for search with artful use of keywords – although your content should always be written for people first and search bots second, you still need to use keywords if you want to have a top search ranking.  </span></p>
<p><b>Link-Building and Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the book we talked about internet authority, which is a rank Google assigns to indicate the relevancy of your website. Link-building can help with that kind of authority as well as the kind we’ve been discussing here. Link-building is the process of getting other websites to link to your site. When an authoritative and reliable website links to yours, their authority rubs off on you. I want to warn you here that you should never buy backlinks to your site. Not only is it something Google can penalize you for doing, but it can also dilute your authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control every site that links back to you, but you can avoid actively pursuing subpar links. Here are some ways to get quality backlinks that will build your authority:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Get your website listed in industry guides and on other sites’ resource pages  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write articles for industry publications (they’ll always include a link to your site at the end of the article). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Write guest blogs for someone else in your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-If you notice an outdated piece on another website, write an updated version of it and email the site with a link to your new piece.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few ways to build quality backlinks. Link-building takes time, which is why some people try to speed up the process by buying links. If you’re tempted to do that, remember that your goal is authority. Paying for links isn’t going to help you reach that goal.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always important to remember that your site reflects you. It will tell your potential customers everything they need to know about you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a blog can be quite simple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need any real technical know-how to do it. You need to know your way around a computer, but you don’t have to be a programmer or know a thing about HTML to set up a great-looking blog. Here are some basic tips, and then we’ll talk about some of the specific options that are available to you.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Pick a snappy name. You want something memorable. It should be unique – meaning you need to research to make sure nobody else has used the name – and relevant to your niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Before you set up your blog and it goes live, you should have some content prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-You should also think about design. The blogging platforms we will discuss here will provide you with templates to use, but you should have an idea of what you want in terms of colors and the overall feel of your blog.  </span></p>
<p><b>Free Options </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned earlier, there are several free options available to you if you don’t have money to spend on your blog. The downside of setting up a free blog is that you won’t own the website. Your URL will include an extension, meaning that instead of:  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yourawesomeblog.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.YourAwesomeBlog.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will look like: </span><a href="http://www.yourawesomeblog.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.YourAwesomeBlog.wordpress.com</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be somewhat at the mercy of the blog hosting site, too. If they go offline for any reason, your blog will be offline as well. Here are some of the most popular free options for blogging:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.WordPress. It’s important to note here that we are talking about WordPress.com, which is a free blogging platform. WordPress.org is software that bloggers use to build their own websites. Setting up a blog on WordPress is very easy. They provide bloggers with dozens of free templates to choose from, and a host of easy-to-use blogging and editing tools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can write blog posts in advance and schedule them for publication, and it’s easy to format text and add images.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.Blogger. Blogger is very similar to WordPress. They provide free templates, drafting, and editing tools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.Weebly. Weebly has a slightly quirkier feel than the other sites mentioned, but it has many of the same features. Again, the big downside of using a free blogging platform is that you won’t own your blog. Your domain name will be diluted by the additional extension on it.  </span></p>
<p><b>Paid Options </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other option you have available to you is to pay to set up your blog. By far the most popular way to do that is to use WordPress.org. WordPress has hundreds of templates available – many are free, but some you may have to pay to use. You can choose a template that is mobile-ready (which I recommend) and choose from hundreds of Plugins that will add features to your blog.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also consider putting your blog on your own website, but that will mean that you might have to wait while you get your website designed and ready to go – something we’ll talk about in the next chapter. You will have the option of migrating your blog from WordPress to your website once you get it set up.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Blogs to Increase Authority </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s talk about why blogging is, in my opinion, one of the best things you can do to increase your authority. To be an authority in a particular niche, it’s not enough simply to have knowledge. You need to have opinions. You need to add value to the conversation by bringing something new to it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, if someone wants the information that’s already available about your niche, they can do exactly what you just did, right? They can research, buy books, watch videos, and educate themselves. There’s no point of blogging if you’re just going to regurgitate information that’s already out there. The best way to use blogging to increase your authority is to find a way to bring something unique to the table.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Find someone else’s old blog post about a key topic, and update it by including new information and adding your personal twist, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Offer up a controversial opinion about something relevant in your niche  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Give your readers advice about how to do something you haven’t seen explained elsewhere.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few options, but I hope you get the idea. You’re going to have competition no matter what you do, but you can always find a way to make something fresh by coming at it from a new angle.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can know the basic definition of authority and desire to be an authority figure in your niche, but it’s something else entirely to know how to convert that knowledge into actual success.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, without the numbers to back up what you say you know, people won’t be too eager to follow you or recognize your authority status.  The fact that I’m an authority figure is a result of my knowledge bringing people (and businesses) to my door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me explain.  The four main pillars of online authority are </span><b>content marketing, social media presence, paid advertising, and publicity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Let’s break this down into individual chunks.   </span></p>
<p><b>Content marketing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most important and crucial aspects you need to master if you want to establish yourself as an authority figure.  As I sort of stated above, without regular content, you cease to be relevant. Any piece of content you publish online qualifies as content marketing, whether you publish regular blogs, articles, videos, or podcasts.  It doesn’t matter what you produce as long as it provides your audience quantifiable value. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also crucial to your success when establishing authority.  Many businesses live or die by how well they are able to communicate via social media.  As of right now, over 2 billion people worldwide use it, and that number is only expected to grow.  This means you need to figure out a way to use this technological advantage in an intelligent way. That means choosing the right social media outlets for your niche and being careful about the content you share. </span></p>
<p><b>Paid advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great for giving your website and social media accounts a bit of a push if you’re having a difficult time drawing traffic without it.  Again, if people haven’t heard of you, you’re not an authority. </span></p>
<p><b>And finally, publicity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re going to have to figure out new and creative ways to get your name out there.  There are plenty of ways to publicize yourself, both online and offline. Build up your social media profiles, attend high-profile events, give speeches, interview other experts in your niche, volunteer, and so much more.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on these four things, you become an authority (an expert) over time.  Most people begin to trust you and frequent your sites. That means that people will be beating a path to your door hoping to get your help and advice – and that can lead you to success in a number of different ways.  </span></p>
<p><b>Using Authority to Your Benefit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a proven track record, you can start charging a consulting fee.  Some of what you used to give away for free to develop your authority status, you will now be charging for.  Set up a paid subscription service or even products/content that you will sell, like a book! Teach an online seminar or class.  Offer paid speaking engagements. These are just a few ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have information that people want, you can name your own price. I don’t mean to imply that it’s easy to become an authority – but it doesn’t have to be difficult, either. You’ll have to put in the time and effort to learn about your chosen topic and produce great content that people will want to consume and share. You can’t be an authority without that. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of marketing truths that seem to fight against human nature. When a lot of new marketers and business owners try to advertise, get the word out, and build authority in their niche, they think about the big picture all at once. When they create ads, they make the mistake of trying to blast their message to everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, 90% of new online businesses go under. One of the biggest reasons why include trying to do too much and being everything to everyone. You’re going to waste money throwing a handful of spaghetti at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. The only way to set yourself apart is by narrowing down your niche and your speciality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don’t Be a Jack-of-all-Trades</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the fastest ways to become an industry leader is by choosing a niche and sticking with it.  You might think it’s an obvious statement, but you’d be surprised by how many people are either stuck and don’t know where to begin or work in general terms, not really choosing one niche, but many.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t be an authority figure in a single market if you consider yourself a jack-of-all-trades.  Dabbling in multiple markets makes sure you stay mediocre because your attention is diverted to different projects at once.  Instead, focus on one project and stick with it.  Not only does it make things simpler for you, you can get a faster start building from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><b>Education-Based Marketing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we attempt to be the best, we often see everyone else as competition, as if there’s only room for one at the top. This is a very cold way of getting things done, as you’re missing out on greater opportunities to reach out and build a community.  Our world is changing.  As we become more globalist in the way we live and do business, it’s no longer feasible to cut anyone out.  Your greatest consumers may very well be your competition.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet has also changed the way we do sales.  Consumers expect immediate access in this digital-driven age.  If you have no way of building trust, you’re not going to get far.  Education-based marketing builds trust quicker than someone who uses traditional marketing.  Rather than using the same tired sales pitches, use blogs, books, and other types of content to educate and give the type of information to help buyers make the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then use this educational-based content and get it published in various outlets.  If you can tell your customers that you’re a published author in the field of marketing, or that you’ve had an article you wrote featured in a top magazine, you have instant authority.  They will feel like they can trust you and are more eager to open their wallet over someone with no content to share at all. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Doing One Thing Really Well</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about restaurants for a moment. The local pizza shop also sells burgers on the cheap. If you really want a great burger, do you go to those guys, or the actual burger shop down the road that’s a bit more expensive? You know exactly who to go to if you want a great burger. The pizza shop who tries to do everything most likely doesn’t even have the best pizza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because they’re focused on trying to do too much. They don’t put out the best product and shouldn’t be considered a leader in the industry. They might make a few bucks on their cheap burgers, but they won’t be the company you think about when you’re really craving a juicy cheeseburger. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business works the same way. By creating educational-based marketing and focusing on that one area of expertise, you can be the ‘go-to’ business your customers flock to. They’re eager to learn and improve their lives, so no matter what you do, they’ll come running back, willing to open their wallets again and again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out a specific niche and start from there.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is essential. If people don’t know you exist, how can find you?  And if they can’t find you, you’re simply not making the sales you need to be successful.  While some marketing will offer results, the right kind of marketing can be the difference between mediocre sales and taking off like a rocket. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, good marketing is like a candle in a dark cave.  It will illuminate not just your product, but your entire empire.  Your eyes and your attention will be drawn towards the light!  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right type of marketing,  doesn’t take much to convince your audience that they NEED your product or service, nor can they live without it.  It resonates with them deep down inside.  It identifies their needs.  It educates them and promises to make them better at life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Marketing Basics</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the big secret for marketing the right way?  It’s all about targeting the right crowd.  Your marketing should attract your target audience, not every single person you can get the message to.  Think about it like this: a bug zapper was designed to attract bugs.  That’s what it was built to do.  It’s not meant to attract kangaroos or crocodiles.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources are finite and attempting to attract people who do not fit the target audience is just like setting your money on fire.  Why?  It goes back to knowing the basics.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People buy things for two reasons: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) For gain. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They want to raise their personal brand and improve their image.  To impress.  Maybe it’s the girl they have a crush on or to secure a promotion.  Maybe it entertains them in ways other products cannot.  The purchase is made with one thing in mind: If I buy this product, what will it do for me?   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often do and buy things because it improves the way other people see us.  How many times have you purchased an item simply to build a relationship with someone?  Whatever we purchase, it’s done with gain in mind.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Rolex as an example.  Why should you buy a Rolex?  Well, as the top watchmaker in the world, owning a Rolex has a bit of prestige added to it.  It’s expensive and says something about you.  If you own a Rolex, you’re pure class. It  tells the world you’re an important person.  So, what is Rolex’s message?  “A Rolex will never change the world.  We leave that to the people who wear them.”   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their message is, if you want to be a person of influence, a world changer, a SOMEBODY, then buy a Rolex.  This is what you buy to gain something. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) To avoid pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t purchase life, health, and car insurance because we have a ton of money laying around and have to buy SOMETHING.  And there’s nothing fun or sexy about an insurance policy.  What about home protection systems?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live Florida, you MUST have hurricane shutters.  Oh yes, there’s just something about a large, bulky, non-see-thru shutter to make your house look great!  (sarcasm) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about dental care?  Do you spend big money on a root canal because the dentist is a good friend of yours and you want to support his practice?  Probably not.  You get a root canal because you need one. You get the point. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t make the investment now, you will definitely feel the pain later!  We buy things to avoid feeling that pain. Take a look at this ad: </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted works very hard.  Ted has everything. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted finally retires, as does his disability policy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted decides to go fishing.  Ted slips on a trout. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ted loses everything.  Don’t be like Ted! </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad then shows Ted in a whole-body cast unable to move.  So why do we spent a lot of money on insurance?  It can almost seem like a waste of money until you’re in Ted’s position.  All it takes is one moment like that, while completely unprotected, to become overwhelmed with hospital bills and eventually losing everything you worked for. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take these two points into account, you should ask yourself what your message is.  What problem are you solving?  How can you make people’s lives better?  Why should anyone buy what you’re selling?  When you do this, it makes your marketing much more effective.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>EDUCATE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your target market on their gain or pain points and how they should depend on your product to soothe their needs. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b>ENTERTAIN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your message, so you can hold their attention and intrigue them. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, your marketing should </span><b>ENGAGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them by making them think.  Get in their head by asking questions they are forced to answer.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the difference between simple marketing and good marketing.  Simple marketing just lets the world know your service or product exists, but it goes no further than that.  It may bring in a few sales, but what does it actually do to target and engage?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With good marketing, you are letting them know WHY they should buy and what you offer that no one else does.  How do you meet their needs in a way they can’t get from someone else down the street? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can market along these guidelines, your customers will be opening their wallets to you in no time!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Bill Gates who once coined the term “content is king.” If you run an online business, you know how crucial it is for you to get your content out in front of as many eyes as possible. Not only do you want to grow the popularity of your content, you will also want to provide your audience with nourishing, sustaining content they desire.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a high ranking on Google, there are a lot of different hoops, strategies, and factors you will have to jump through. It can be quite overwhelming to understand, especially for a marketer who just wants to get their content out there. So, let us take look at one of those strategies in particular: internal links.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The Power of the Internal Link</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal link is essentially just a hyperlink that allows you to connect different pages of your website. These make navigating your site a lot easier. And when you have content that is easily accessible from other parts of your website, it allows your audience to spend more time on your site. They end up clicking on all kinds of different things, which is great for you.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a ranking power within your website. If you have a lot of pages and posts that link to each other, and your audience is clicking on things, your ranking will improve. It also helps bots find your ‘obscure’ content and learn how to better understand how your website works.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone is enjoying your content, and you have a proper internal linking structure within that content, they’re going to spend a lot more time combing through your website, clicking on things, and getting to know you better. The amount of time people spend on your website is a huge factor in how your ranking is determined.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Making Internal Links a Part of Your SEO Strategy</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal linking only works if you have a lot of relevant content on your site. Therefore, it is so important to have a content strategy prepared to help with your Google ranking. A lot of marketers and online business owners invest heavily in making sure they are producing content on a regular basis for this very reason.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to remember not to just throw any links into your content as you see fit. It must serve a purpose and the relevant to that specific piece. Think of it like a roadmap. You want your readers to go from A to B to C and to reach a positive conclusion about what you offer. Just throwing any link in there might confuse or throw off some readers and cause more harm.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Creating Cornerstone Content</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind cornerstone content is having maybe 4 to 5 different pieces that really define who you are and what you do. These are the authority pieces everyone should read. They are also the pieces that you want to rank highly on Google. No matter the different offshoot types of content you want to create, they should always link back to one of the cornerstone pieces.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this is to define exactly what you are about. You might have a variety of different pieces of content that might not be so clear to some readers, so if they can link back to the cornerstone content, it will be more obvious to them what you stand for and what your message is. They also should not compete with the other types of content on your page.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must also remember not to forget about repurposing old content, so make them a part of your internal linking SEO strategy. By doing so, it will help Google see that the old works are still relevant, helping your site’s ranking even further.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is king, there is no doubt about it. Making sure all your content has internal links will give your ranking a boost and increase the number of people who will find your stuff. Not only that, but it provides your audience with more information, which they will often appreciate. Just by doing this one step, you should see immediate results.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for a reason to upgrade your website, this is it! Google announced earlier this week their intention to implement a new mobile search algorithm designed to give preference to faster sites.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google calls it the “Speed Update” and not everyone will feel the impact. If your site measures up in the speed department, you’ll likely see no change in how you’re ranked. According to the search engine giant, only a “small percentage” of sites, the ones who consistently rank low when it comes to loading times.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is yet another step by Google to improve user performance. It was only back in 2010 when they stated their full intention and focus was on desktop user speed, but it was only a few short years later in 2014 when the number of mobile users surpassed those who used the site on their desktop.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this shift in user preference, many industries have had to change the way they create and display ads. They suddenly had to be both desktop and mobile friendly, a lesson Facebook instantly learned when the mobile revolution took off. They weren’t prepared and had one of the worst online mobile apps on the internet.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing how quickly things were changing, Facebook, went into action and continues to find new ways to give mobile users the best experience possible. Now Google is jumping in and rewarding the sites with faster speeds.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is clear: if you’re not actively working to improve mobile reach, your competitors will get the traffic. It’s okay though. You have plenty of time to prepare your website for the change. The new algorithm isn’t set to be in place until July 2018.</span></p>

		<title>Google is Still Updating Penguin and Panda Updates for SEO</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, algorithms. Love them or hate them, where would your business be today without algorithms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the online world, algorithms make or break everything. And no, I’m not exaggerating. Try marketing on Facebook when they decide to change the way people see what you post. You can go from having amazing sales to barely getting a drop in the bucket, all because they decided to change their algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is the same way. Over the years, they’ve had different programs in place that marketers have learned to adapt into their marketing platform. In the beginning, Google was easy to use. They rarely updated any of their programming. If they made an update, you would have to change anything for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a technological age advanced and more people started filing their way in, Google needed to find a way to compete. The only way to do that is to constantly update your algorithms. It started with Google Coffee, which later became Panda and Penguin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s not so uncommon if Google updates several times a day rather than every few months. As much as it stings a lot of marketers, Google and Facebook do not care about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They care about the everyday user and ensuring that all search results cater to their needs. This is why you need to be careful if you do business online. It was recently confirmed by a Google employee, who has been with the company for over six years, that they STILL update Panda and Penguin despite moving on to a new algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to be aware of this as any unannounced changes will leave you in your website unprepared and you out of luck. It will disrupt your flow of traffic, drop your rankings on Google, and even mess with the accessibility of your site.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficult part is knowing when they start to tweak. Again, because these changes are purely for the consumer and everyday user, Google doesn’t feel the need to alert marketers of this change. In fact, it had been long believed that Panda and Penguin were obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that it’s been confirmed that they still update it from time to time, that should be a big enough of a warning to anyone in this space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>tend to get this question a lot with my clients, “Alex, how can I take my content and be able to get the traffic quickly?”</p>
<p>Well, the these are some steps I take in sharing my content and being able to increase Alexa rank and overal SERP’s (search engine result position).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Share your new post on all social media platforms.</strong>Begin sharing on all your accounts, but not just the main post. You want to also post in the groups as well. Did you even know <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linked In</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and Twitter &#8211; have those? If not, I suggest you either create one in your market or look for some that are relative to not only your post…. But your audiences as well.
<p>Don’t even forget to hashtag the discussion that may be popular for others to discover as well. I see this strategy overlooked a lot. Although it may not see immediate results from this, it’s best to conquer all areas then to question “have I done it?”</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Post on forums and discussions.</strong>The main one I find to help a lot is Reddit. This site can do wonders for traffic! I mean gaining quick traffic with people constantly browsing for things is great. You wouldn’t imagine the different topics you can find that will fit your post. So be sure to look into this one as a priority.</li>
<li><strong>Place photo’s on Pinterest, Tumblr, and other picture oriented sites from your content.</strong>If you have an image that your posting about, or just perhaps something to place in the content to make it more visual for the readers… share it! There are ton of websites to work with on your image. Be sure to link it. (Sure it may not be a back link, but it’s still an outside traffic referral source.)</li>
<li><strong>Social bookmark your content.</strong>Sure <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> isn’t the same as it used to be, but it is still a source. I find to use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stumbleupon/">Stumble Upon Toolbar</a> a lot more cause  I actually see the page index from it, and it&#8217;s convient. But be sure to use this tactic as another source for people to share as well.</li>
<li><strong>Link Exchange.</strong>Always look for potential link exchanges with other sites/authors to share the content with outside readers that you normally wouldn&#8217;t reach.</li>
<li> <strong>Add paid sources to your content for visible traffic.</strong>When gathering data and more we like to utilize Outbrain and Taboola as sources for additional traffic to gain some information as to whether the content was captive, informational, or even viral. If you have Adsense this would be a great affordable traffic that can reduce the overhead cost with the traffic coming in.
<p>For more information I would be sure to refer to this <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/29/sharing-great-posts/">site</a>. I believe his outline covers mine but gives some additional tips. Best of luck and keep writing!</li>
