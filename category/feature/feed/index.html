				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the most part, technology hasn’t changed the way humans have lived for most of our history on this planet.  Think about it for a second.  For thousands of years, what mode of transportation have our ancestors shared?  Horses.  Wagons.  It wasn’t until 1885 when Karl Benz invented the first car.  Look at how far we’ve come just in the last 100+ years.</p>
<p>In 1914, if you wanted to travel to Asia from the United States, it would’ve taken you 40 days.  Now, we have supersonic jets that will cross the Pacific in about 14 hours. As of this writing, they are currently researching and building jets that can take you from New York to London in about 20 minutes.  </p>
<p>Travel is just the beginning.  Think about all the advancements in medicine, hygiene, genetics, vaccines, food, surgical care, housing, consumer products, buying and selling, radio, TV, video games, electricity, heat/air conditioning, refrigeration, telephones, space travel, cameras, and computers.  These are all relatively new advancements that have changed the course of human history forever.</p>
<p>These advances haven’t only impacted the way we live and how we entertain ourselves, but it also changed the business world forever.  Thanks to the internet, we’re now a highly-connected species.  Who would’ve ever imagined having the ability to video chat with someone instantly who lived on the other side of the planet?  </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Founder of Facebook, boasts having connected nearly 2 billion people with his platform.  That’s 2 billion people who are spread out across the globe, but thanks to the internet, they might as well be in the next room.  This type of connectivity has allowed for major changes in how we do business.</p>
<p>Consider that for thousands of years, up until about 15-20 years ago, the strongest industries were involved in natural resources, like coal, oil, wood, and mining.  Suddenly, the internet goes commercial, connecting the world, and changing how companies compete globally.  The top companies in the world are now tech giants, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.</p>
<p>CEOs now make billions on ideas, instead of commodities.</p>
<p>As the world continues to get smaller, we are becoming more of a melting pot.  Cultures are mixing, as are languages and lifestyles.  When you have a variety of different people and languages living in one area, it can complicate the infrastructure of government, business, schools, and even the economy</p>
<p>As a budding entrepreneur, the secret to success is tapping into this resource and knowing how to use technology to your advantage. There’s no other medium where you can reach across the globe and advertise your products to millions than social media. You’ll have to learn about demographics, scaling ads, and how to reach an audience.</p>
<p>If you want your website to get traffic, you’ll need to know how to utilize SEO in your content. You’ll need to design a website that’s fast, efficient, and catches the eye.</p>
<p>The toughest part for new online entrepreneurs to understand is how quickly the tech is changing. It seems as if new stuff comes out every other day. If you struggle with keeping up, or you have no idea where to start, you have two options:</p>
<p>1) Take several years and try to figure it out yourself.<br />
2) Find a company who already knows how to do it and hire them.</p>
<p>Agencies like Pub Club Leads are experts helping people get on the right track right out of the gate. The last thing you want to do is start your business already behind. It costs new entrepreneurs several years and many thousands of dollars’ worth of failed attempts before they get a grasp on what they’re doing.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re doing, your best bet is to ask for help. It doesn’t matter if you need a little bit of help, or a lot of it. All it takes is a single wrongly-worded ad to keep your sales down.</p>
<p>The technology revolution isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Right now is the perfect time to pursue that business idea, but don’t do it alone. Let Pub Club Leads guide you through the process and give you the edge you need to outsmart your competitors and make the kind of money you always dreamed you’d make working from home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce sales hit new record highs for 2016 and 2017. The same will be true in 2018, especially as the economy continues to roll. With wages growing and people paying less in taxes, we can only expect the 2018 season, Christmas especially, to offer plenty of bonuses and surprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the growth of retail sales overall, 42% of it happened online. As each year passes, it would seem as if e-commerce sales have double digit increases. In 2016, e-commerce sales rose by 15.6%, coming in just shy of $400 billion. In 2017, online sales were 18% higher still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who’s been alive for the last 20 years can see how dramatically the Internet has changed the way we shop, work, and live. The Internet has conquered many industries and sent once proud and flourishing businesses running for the hills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember Blockbuster? Replaced by Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever been to Borders books? Replaced by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can write an entire case study based upon Amazon alone. They’re currently building fulfillment centers near every major US city and are developing advanced technologies, such as the use of drones, to make deliveries quicker and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to wonder if the advancement of Amazon is why most major retail stores, who were vastly unprepared for the Internet age, are quickly going out of business. Sales do not look good for the major brick-and-mortar outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the brick-and-mortar stores seem to be on the decline, retail sales overall jumped by 3.9%. How is that possible? Well, let’s just say there’s a reason why Walmart is now calling for an all-out war against Amazon for a piece of the online action. This comes as Walmart closes more stores and lays off more workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Now is the Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had one piece of advice for you, it would be to jump in right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are just now starting to get wise to the fact that they can make big money by taking advantage of the massive growth in e-commerce sales. New students in the game currently are raking in $5,000 to $10,000 each month. And that’s just the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce market is smoking hot and it is growing by leaps and bounds each year. During the holidays, Black Friday was the only day you could get amazing sales, but now there’s Cyber Monday to take advantage of the rapid increase of online sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to jump into something that not a whole lot of people know yet, but continues to be in a massive upward trend, it would be ecommerce. As larger chunks of retail sales are made online, you’ll be in the prime spot to take advantage of this niche for years to come.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what you sell at your Ecommerce store, it’s a safe bet you’re constantly searching for new ways to improve sales.  It may seem like a constant work-in-progress with sluggish growth, leaving you discover new ways to improve your conversion rates.  But because there are numerous factors that impact conversions, it’s not always an easy proposition. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article we will investigate several proven methods that can help you get your numbers up and put more money in your pocket.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1) Use images.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Humans are visual creatures.  If they’re going to buy something from you, they’ll want to see exactly what they’re buying.  And it’s not about just slapping any old picture up either.  In fact, 67% of consumers believe that it’s ‘very important’ for them to see a quality image of a product before they buy it.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To show you how important a quality image is to the consumer, that 67% is higher than customer reviews/ratings, which is at 53%, a good description at 54%, and even the product information itself at 63%.  That goes to show that people would rather see a product with their own eyes than read about it, as words can be deceptive or be written cleverly. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense.  When reading a product description, you’re relying solely on imagination.  A good-quality image reveals so much more.  So if you want to make a bigger impact and initiate more sales, add several pictures from different angles.  Maybe even make them zoom-able. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2) Product descriptions are still important</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Yes, customers want to see the images, but having a product description to go along with high-quality images can make all the difference.  The key is to give your customers as much information as possible so they can make an informed choice on what’s right for them.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes without saying, but be descriptive, honest, relevant, and concise.  Get their curiosity buzzing.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>3) Create a video.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If you think photos and descriptions are powerful, you haven’t seen anything yet.  I have several amazing statistics regarding video that may leave you wondering why you never posted videos before.   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Videos build trust.  58% of consumers believe that companies who have a video of their product are more trustworthy than those who don’t. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The word ‘video’ appears in about 14% of ALL internet search results.  That means people want to see a video before they buy. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-This is a really big one: 73% more people will buy if they see a product video.  Yes, you read that correctly.  73%!   </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers are heightened because a video allows a potential customer to do more than just look at a picture or read a description.  They get to watch the product in its natural habitat, which is the closest they will come to being able to touch it themselves before deciding to buy.  Of course not every business is ready to shoot and display a ton of videos, but consider it for high-ticket items or those you really want to get rid of, but sales might be sluggish. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>4) Get rid of shipping costs.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  A study was conducted that revealed the number one reason why 44% of potential customers abandoned the sale: shipping and handling costs.  Another retail study revealed that nine out of ten people surveyed considered ‘free shipping’ as the greatest incentive for them to keep buying.  93% said they would buy more online products. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason cited for these statistics has to do with one amount displayed on the screen, then when they go to checkout, an additional amount is added.  It can be frustrating to be surprised with extra costs.  To combat this issue, it’s best to either offer a flat fee or mention up front the costs associated with the item so there’s no shock at the checkout line. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just a handful of ways to improve your ecommerce conversion rates.  It’s always best to experiment with different options to find what works best for you.</span></p>
